### Problem Statement
In land-scarce Singapore, housing not only provides a roof over peopleâ€™s heads but also works out to be one of the largest assets families hold over their lifetimes. However, choosing a property which has a high-yield potential is no easy feat.

We are a team of data scientists working for a property investment company seeking to help meet the higher aspirations of rising middle to upper-middle class Singaporeans who might otherwise be outpriced in the private property market. We are tasked to build a housing price prediction model to help prospective homeowners find a home which aim to flip public housing for monetary gain.

### Brief Summary of Analysis
There are 4 code notebooks under the [`code`](./code/) folder for this project.
- 01. Baseline model: a baseline regression model is fitted to the train.csv dataset and evaluated
- 02. Test data preparation: test.csv dataset is prepared for predictions based on the various models tested - the prepared dataset has been saved under the [`output`](./code/output/) folder
- 03. Model tuning: different models and features are selected and evaluated to find the model with the best score
- 04. Further EDA & conclusions: visuals are made to further examine the dataset and form conclusions and recommendations
  - Find the trend in housing resale prices based on different flat types
  - Find the trend of the resale prices based on the planning area the flats are in

The Kaggle submissions have been saved under the [`output`](./code/output/) folder.

### Conclusions and Recommendations
- We have decided to use a RidgeCV model for this task.
- Our model is able to predict the resale price of the public housing of Singapore with an R^2 score of 0.914 on the train dataset and 0.912 on the test dataset.
- With our model, a prospective investor can be recommended a flat which is undervalued on the market based on the model prediction. For instance, if the flat is listed at \$300,000 but our model predicts that it can be sold for \$350,000, such a flat will be recommended so that the investor will make a profit.

- The resale price is highly correlated to the floor area of the flat, measured in square metres.
- As such, we have investigated the trend of the resale price based on the flat types which generally correspond to the floor area.
- Resale prices have seen a downward trend across most flat types from 2013 to 2019, with the exception of multi-generation flat type.
- This fall in resale prices is due to the [reduction of the Mortgage Servicing Ratio (MSR)](https://www.homequarters.com.sg/2020/06/03/2013-the-fateful-year-that-caused-hdb-prices-to-plunge-10/) introduced in 2013 and the increase in BTO supply.
- From 2019 to 2021, most of the resale prices have bounced back up across most flat types, with the exception of multi-generation flat type. The percentage increase is led by 3-room flats at 13.1%, followed by 4-room flats at 12.8% and 2-room flats at 11.3%. This shows the bullish demand for such flat types and hence can prove profitable for prospective investors.
- This rise in resale prices coincides with the start of Covid-19 in which most of the construction and completion of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats was delayed due to government restrictions, causing a fall in supply of new-builds and new homeowners having to turn to the resale market. 
---
- Most planning areas see an increase in resale prices from 2019 to 2021 as well.
- From 2019 to 2021, the planning areas with at least 15% increase in the resale price are in Clementi (19.3%), followed by Choa Chu Kang (18.4%), Geylang (18.1%), Queenstown (17.1%), Bedok (16.9%), Sembawang (16.1%), Jurong East (15.9%), Hougang (15.9%), Bukit Batok (15.7%), Woodlands (15.5%), and Toa Payoh (15.0%). Thus, prospective investors can be recommended these high-growth areas.

### Limitations
- There were only a limited 56 multi-generation flats and 81 1-room flats transacted over the 10 years of analysis in the dataset. In addition, according to [99.co](https://www.99.co/singapore/insider/is-buying-a-multigenerational-hdb-flat-a-good-idea/), there are many factors involved in getting multi-generation flats yet are not captured in the dataset so the model might not be able to predict the price of such flats well.
- More research has to be done to find out the reasons for the increase in resale prices in the high-growth areas (e.g. new development) and if there are any more upcoming development plans as the resale prices might plateau or have peaked.
> For example, although Kallang has only seen an increase of 3.3% in the resale price form 2019 to 2021, there are plans to [transform the existing Kallang Industrial Estate](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Planning/Master-Plan/Urban-Transformations/Kallang-River) in the longer term into an attractive mixed-use precinct along the waterfront. There is also a vision for Kampong Bugis (a stone's throw away from Kallang) to become an attractive residential and recreational precinct that supports active mobility, environmental sustainability, and fosters community interaction.
- September 2022 saw another set of cooling measures rolled out by the Singapore government to curb house prices thus our model might not be able to extrapolate on future resale prices well.

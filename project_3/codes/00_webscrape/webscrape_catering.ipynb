I LOVE lobster but am wondering if it is so great that I should book it twice or just the once? A couple more ponderings on this matter - is the meal service for SQ334 reduced because it is a late night flight? So would it be better to BTC on this segment incase the food offerings are less. And...are there two meal services on SQ281? - it leaves SIN at 8:45am so I don't think I'd feel like lobster for breakfast (I love it - but not that much!!) or do they serve a dinner later and would I get it for that? So many questions Thanks to all you wise ones who have gone before. \"},\n",

Breakfast on the inbound DEL-SIN return flight in the morning. Martini (Gin, vermouth, olive...cabin crew actually asked how I wanted it done.) When did they get rid of the bowls? No more debate about warmed/not warmed nuts then. Superb main by chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Tender lamb, fluffy rice, and flavourful dhall. Only reinforces my perception that spicy cuisines like Indian food work great on flights. '},\n",

It would seem to me to just be about the wide variety of food covered by the term Asian and needing to be a bit more specific. It is not too surprising considering the popularity of Indian food in the UK that they are more likely to provide that style of Asian food leaving the UK to try to appeal to as many customers as possible. Now if they start having to specify which type of curry then that would be the UK's fault as definitely in the UK if you say curry people will fist and foremost think of an Indian style curry. \"},\n",

They serve with proper ikan bilis and prawn sambal, rather than chicken. See photos here: http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/cont...f-menu-biz.pdf Controversially, I also much prefer the MAS satay - it is rich and sticky and meaty, but also just burnt and caramelised enough. SQ satay is often tougher and the sauce is more watery - just my experience! MH is not nearly as good as SIA on so many dimensions, but when it comes to local food they cannot be beaten in my experience.

       "  'reply': \" Hi! Does anyone here have pics of how post weaning meal look like and a child meal for infant? I've made a request for that for my 1 yo (by then) kid who will be travelling with us to Perth. I was checking SQ website and the description is as follows: Post-Weaning Meal (PWMLM) Suitable for infants between 1 and 2 years old, this meal is more substantial than a Baby Meal. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest. Child Meal for Infant (CHMLI) Suitable for infants less than 2 years old, this meal is more substantial in terms of quantity and choice of meal components. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest. I can't tell the difference between the 2 and the person over the phone said they were the same (???) except portion is probably bigger for CHMLI? \"},\n",

It actually tastes decent, and is awesomely healthy. But its not for all kids. My son took to it very quickly because he we have been feeding him Chicken and Carrot with little seasoning so he didn't mind that. I saw that you're book in J, so another route you could do is to book the cook Congee, let your infant have that, and ask for a spare Business Meal. Works the last time for me to LHR as well. And the Congee tastes very tasty \"},\n",

Travelled in J too (albeit only to TPE) but mine came in a tray with plastic casseroles. One big casserole with 2 or 3 types of minced / half pureed food inside. I also tried to BTC the Congee, but the reservations claimed it was only available for breakfast meals (IIRC, mine was brunch). The portions were quite big, my son only managed to finish like 1/3, as probably he was restless during the flight and probably just had milk not too long ago. I didn't take pictures either since I don't usually do TRs and handling my son is already too much trouble. \"},\n",

I've never really cared for their BTC steak. It's supposed to be a juicy ribeye, but almost always ended up being this dry filet-like piece of meat. The last great steak I had in SQ F was a wagyu ribeye that feature on the menu of SQ 308 sometime in August 2009. The following year, this had been replaced by strips of meat rolled in mushroom and overdoused with XO sauce. Very sad indeed.

(I looked, but I can't find a menu on SQTALK for this segment) Well not all SQTalkers like to post menu. That's why we don't have all the menu. And yes, it reminds me that someone out there has promised to scan some menus for me, and I haven't received them yet. Yes, it's supper first, then mid-flight snack, and followed by before touch down meals, which is brunch-type meals. I understand that many of you will feel that with the arrival time at SFO before dinner time, SQ should serve heavier meals prior to land. But, remember that most pax will sleep in the plane, and when they get up they would rather have something lighter, and also the fact that the body clock time would be different than SFO time. Anyway, the supper on SQ2 will let you do BTC: Menu Grilled chicken breast with capsicum, tomato salsa and potatoes Grilled fillet of beef with shallot tarragon sauce, French beans, roasted pumpkin and black pepper mashed potatoes Pan-fried sea bass with sun-dried tomato pesto, mixed vegetables, and potatoes Stir-fried prawns and scallops with braised beans in leek and red wine vinaigrette with vegetables Braised assorted mushrooms in bean curd skin, seasonal vegetables, and steamed rice Braised pork ball Shanghai style with bok choy, carrots, and vegetable rice Chirashi Sushi Deep-fried salmon with garlic cloves, chu hau sauce, vegetables, and steamed rice Steamed egg with scallops, mixed vegetables and rice Stir-fried chicken and abalone with Chinese greens and steamed rice Thai style red beef curry, selected vegetables and steamed rice If you want, you can try order the BTC, and when aboard in HKG, tell the crew that you want your BTC to be served prior to land in SFO. Of course, the 10 hours later might affect the quality of the meals. Anyway, last time I was in this flight, I was perfectly happy with the light meals served prior to land. \"},\n",

I was most disappointed after \"treating\" myself to a box of TWG English Breakfast tea bags (at not insignificant cost) to come to this negative realisation; oddly enough, I actually have a pleasant memory of TWG E.B. tea when I drank it in T2 and T3 SKL J last year, both occasions when prepared in a mug.

I honestly didn\\'t enjoy my first KK meal about a year ago. It was too \"authentic\" if that is the right description. I do enjoy sashimi and almost all Japanese foods, not just rolls, but I never warmed to the simplicity of the tastes. Based on the descriptions in the press release (http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacen...ws/NE_3010.jsp), it does seem like the menu being served would suit me better - tuna belly sashimi with cucumber and tomato jelly; lobster poached in white miso soup; grilled duck with miso-sansho sauce and teriyaki scallop).

So, anyone had any experience of the Low fat meals in F? What are they like? Thanks J According to the website: Low Fat/Cholesterol Meal: No animal fats but poly-unsaturated fatty acids allowed; limited fats/sauces/gravy fried items; no butter/cream/whole milk cheese; only lean meat allowed I have never ordered one. So I don't know what you will get on board. But, from my personal experience, when I had to watch my health, I should eat in moderation, as well as know what I should not eat. I was able to order from the main menu by doing mis-match things up. From the definition of the low fat - low cholesterol, pick lean meat. And yeah no heavy salad dressing, olive oil should be fine I think. I will skip butter. And pick the vegetables from the menu which looks better for my health. Of course, if your doctor really wants you to have a very very strict low fat diet, that will be a different story! \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" I got some nice B'cake when I flew Air Canada in F way back in the late 80's when I flew LHR-BOM-SIN. In fact I got 2 cakes! And once when I was surprising a friend on a CDG-YYZ flight around 1990 in Y, his boarding pass showed up as 'SPML' which he translated as I've booked him a special meal which he didn't want.. The crew came out halfway during the flight with dimmed cabin lights, a birthday cake with a candle (and lit as well) , a card, and champage in 2 plastic cups. Well, things would be different now..but I thought I'd share this with you! Ah such memories.... I would really have to fly on my birthday again..! Spent the last 5 in a stuffy old english college as the annual course I took was always right in the middle of my birthday! \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" I was on SIN-PVG flight 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised with the chinese meal. It was a complete set (appetizer, soup, main course, and dessert), just like kyo kaiseki menu. When I asked the LSS about it, she said it's just been recently introduced (around March). Here's the details from SQ website: 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn) First Class customers travelling on selected flights between Singapore and China can look forward to a new Chinese fine dining experience with the introduction of 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn), an elegant and complete Chinese meal available for lunch or dinner service. The name - translated in English as \\x93treasured culinary creations from a famed and reputable establishment\\x94 - highlights the partnership between renowned master chefs and the Airline. 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn) is specially created for Singapore Airlines by acclaimed masterchefs Sam Leong and Zhu Jun, both members of our International Culinary Panel and renowned authorities in the art of Chinese cuisine. First Class customers will be treated to timeless Chinese fare made up of an exquisite array of ingredients that will impress even the most discerning of palettes. Anyway, it was really really good and super tasty. I really recommend it! It's a pity this menu is not available for book the cook as I rarely fly to China.. Here are some pictures (a bit blurry, sorry). Appetizer and soup Main course (beef with black bean sauce, black cod fish, shimeji rice) \"},\n",

The distinctive white \"Theme Building\"--built by architects Paul Williams and Welton Becket in 1961--resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. Suspended beneath two intersecting arches that form the legs is a restaurant that offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the airport. The Los Angeles City Council designated the building a cultural and historical monument in 1992.

       "  'reply': \" Another vote for the LHR flights. Not only excellent catering, but excellent crews as well. Seems like SQ really takes an extra step on this route. For SIN-LHR I usually go with SQ320 or SQ322 depending on how schedule works for me. If I am on leisure or in no need of a rush for meetings, I would go for SQ320. This flight IMO has the most comprehensive meal service of all the long haul sectors. I've always felt I've gained extra weight after taking this flight with a heavy lunch after takeoff and a heavy dinner before landing. Plus it arrives into town just in time for bed and a fresh day the following morning. If I am in a rush and can't sacrifice an extra day of flying, SQ322 works the best for me. Gets me into London early in the morning where I can check into my hotel and take a brief nap 8-8:30 am and be ready for my meeting or appointment. And yes I do love the SQ the fresh egg breakfast which I get on SQ322. Though I have to admit it feels awkward to be eating breakfast at 3 or 4 am UK time. And often this flight arrives (sometimes the 1st flight to arrive morning into LHR) very early that Fast Track is not opened yet and my eyes would still be in GAGA mode by the time I get out. SQ308 IMO is the worst of the 3 flights in terms of timing. Taking this flight means waking up at OMG hours for departure and by the time you arrive into LHR, its only 3PM and you still have another 7 hours to burn and stay awake. On LHR-SIN, without a doubt my favorite is SQ319. Full dinner service after takeoff with great variety of choices and quality and just in time for the pampering of turn down service for bed afterwards. Wake up for breakfast and a smooth early afternoon arrival. I've taken this flight already 3 times this year for the eastbound Kangaroo route (twice connecting to AKL, once connecting to SYD). Even though SQ321 is the flight that is suppose to connect immediately to SQ285 or SQ221, I've always used SQ319 to connect to these flights and don't mind the long layover in SIN. Gives me the opportunity to sleep & swim at the transit hotel and take care of my paper work inside the SKL for 6-7 hours. As a matter of fact will be using SQ319 again to connect to SQ285 on the return trip this month. IMO the meals on SQ321 is not as comprehensive as 319 and certainly feels strange to depart LHR at night, sleep and then wake up to realize it's near evening in SIN and certainly makes it difficult to sleep again on the following sector to Aus/NZ. I've never taken SQ317 and have no intentions in doing so anytime soon. This is by far the worst flight timing among the 3 LHR-SIN. Too early to sleep with the noon departure and then by the time you are tired, it is almost time to land into SIN EARLY MORNING. So my order of preference top to bottom from most preferable to least would be: SIN-LHR: 1) SQ320 2) SQ322 3) SQ308 (avoid if possible) LHR-SIN: 1) SQ319 2) SQ321 3) SQ317 (avoid if possible) Just a note from my experience that satay is served on SQ320 (Dinner)/319 (Dinner) but not on SQ322/321. As stated earlier, never taken 308/317 and have no idea if satay is available for these flights. Also in addition to the LHR flights, I have fallen in love with SQ286/285 operating the AKL sectors. Like SQ320, SQ286 is a daytime flight with nice meal offerings - light lunch after takeoff and full dinner (satay included) prior to landing. This 10.5 hour sector gives pax just enough time to get a feel of what F class is like by staying awake for most of the flight. On the return, SQ285 IMO is much better than SQ221 to SYD because the extra long hours of flying gives me just the amount of time needed to sleep in regular duration whereas SQ221 is just way to short to catch sufficient amount of rest. If one is flying SIN-SYD I would instead advice them to take the daytime flight SQ219 and avoid the later two overnight flights as there is just not enough flying time to get a descent amount of sleep. \"},\n",

Hmm, the slipper lobster is unfortunately not a true lobster, as in the sort you'd find in lobster sashimi. It is a crustacean though, so it has that same meat texture as other crustaceans, but much smaller than a true lobster. Some may find it a little underwhelming. And it's not very expensive. In Australia, it's called a bug, as in Balmain Bug or Moreton Bay Bug. I guess slipper lobster sounds better than bug. \"},\n",

Should add that on my flight we asked for our meal to be served later, because we'd completely overloaded at the F Class Lounge at the Airport. But they forgot to serve us our Muesli/Cereal or to gave us the pick of the bread basket and there definitely was no garlic bread.

Christmas Eve dinner and also Christmas Day breakfast in SIN SKL, then Christmas Day lunch and dinner. I think I will still BTC just in case. I will have a very short flight on Chinese New Year eve to BKK in SQ J. I wonder if they will serve a CNY festive menu on such a short flight. \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" 24 April 2009 Braised abalone with pickled cucumber Wakame seaweed soup with scallop and dried oyster Braised lamb with red dates and daikon Warm eight treasure rice with strawberry ice cream and caramel sauce These are just a sampling of the many mouth-watering creations, that will soon be tantalizing the palates of Singapore Airlines customers. From 1 May, these choices will be part of a range of new dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美) making its debut in the First Class cabins onboard Singapore Airlines flights departing from Beijing and Shanghai. Exclusive to Singapore Airlines, Shi Quan Shi Mei was conceptualised as a presentation of the richness and diversity of Chinese culinary heritage. First introduced in 2005, the latest choices for this popular inflight Chinese fine dining experience are the creations of award-winning Chinese chef Zhu Jun (朱俊), the newest member of the International Culinary Panel. Winner of \\x91Excellent Chef\\x92 at the 15th China Chef Festival, Chef Zhu is currently the Vice General Manager and Executive Chef of Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering, one of China\\x92s leading restaurant chains, and an icon synonymous with elegance, quality and service excellence. Shi Quan Shi Mei will be presented as an elegant spread of specially created Chinese delicacies, including appetizers, a double-boiled soup, four entrees, and dessert. Customers can look forward to savouring these new dishes, which carry Chef Zhu\\x92s signature Shanghainese touch, with clear notes of provincial influences. Well known for his innovative approach to the creation and development of new dishes, Chef Zhu has also taken several classic ingredients and transformed them into dishes that will leave customers impressed by the versatility of modern Chinese cuisine. \\x93When designing and conceptualising the individual dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei, I sought to keep true to age-old Chinese culinary traditions, while also adopting a philosophy that emphasizes the use of the freshest produce. The choices we will be presenting all involve the region\\x92s choice seasonal ingredients,\\x94 said Chef Zhu. He added: \\x93I am happy that Singapore Airlines has given me this opportunity, to showcase to the world, the remarkable new developments in Chinese cuisine. I hope that Singapore Airlines customers will like the new choices in the Shi Quan Shi Mei lineup, and I look forward to creating even more dishes for their enjoyment.\\x94 The new dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei will be available on the First Class cabin of flights departing from Beijing and Shanghai. Customers onboard flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, and San Francisco (via Hong Kong) will continue to enjoy popular dishes designed by Singapore\\x92s very own Sam Leong, another world-class chef on the International Culinary Panel, whose creations regularly grace Shi Quan Shi Mei menus. About the International Culinary Panel Since its inception in 1998, the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel continually pushed the envelope, in redefining inflight dining on Singapore Airlines. Tasked with satisfying the demands of an increasingly sophisticated traveller, the Panel has evolved over the years to reflect the diversity of excellent cuisine around the world as well as to demonstrate the Airline's commitment to offering the finest inflight dining experience to its customers. The Panel works closely with the Airline\\x92s own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available on board. Members on the Panel include Georges Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States); Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom); and Zhu Jun (China).

Assuming that's the case, was it a total flight time of around 9-10 hours ? Not that much quicker than a 747 today but I seem to remember reading somewhere that Concorde was limited in its speed over land due to the sonic boom etc ? Apart from the kudos of flying supersonic, it's also interesting to see that the food options nowadays in SQ F (even leaving aside BTC) seem a lot better than on Concorde.

Just returned from a round trip today and found out the food was totally changed , flown them also earlier this month but food is as usual bad . But today is surprising.. Morning flight SQ 951 1. Beef Rendang with Rice ( side view gosh it looked yummy ) I ordered this one but the steward mistakenly gave me the Crepes, never mind I need something light. 2. Choco crepe rolled with Cherry Jam with a peach .surprisingly its good ! What I love most is no more omelet and sausage LOL ( Normally no choices and they gave you only these ) Return Flight SQ 960 Steward : Sir , would you like chicken with rice or beef wif potato ? 1. Chicken with Rice ( I thought its the normal hainanese chicken with rice( rice always so dry) with pak choy and mushroom ) indeed its curry chicken with some curry vegetables and rice , and it looks yummy. too bad i didnt choose it. 2. Beef sausage with Mash potato and green beans. I took this one gambling , but its GOOD ! the sausage is not normal sausage but somehow more meaty and tasty. Mash potato was so great. the green bean is well cooked. The side dish ( new one too , its wonderful ) Do they changed the menu ? Sorry for messy report '},\n",

Designed by International Culinary Panel Chef Carlo Cracco Review: The fish was fresh, moist and very well-cooked. The tanginess of the citrus vinaigrette perked up in a wonderful way. My problem with it and i think it is a major issue is the legumes / lentils. They seem to be chickpeas and lentils to me, but what were served were chewy. I suspect undercooked. I don't think it was intended. If the chickpeas were soft and moist, and the lentils like how puy lentils supposed to be, then I think this dish could have been a favourite of mine.

My dearest StarG: Just in case this rumour goes circling round again like many others on the board. Here is my sincere humble reply to you. The panel of Wine Connoisseurs (featured in the wine list) conducts an independent bidding and blind tasting every year. They narrow down their choices according to classes, price for its quality and the amount of bottles (bulk) SQ can purchase. Thus, they will not select one chateau that can support ONLY one month of supply. To put it in short, it's an official tender exercise...just like any other purchase but decided independently by the 3 wine experts. Mr StarG, do you know how much of products are consumed on board? I hope this will straighten the rumour that goes around. -The Insider Loop- \"},\n",

Perhaps my English is inadequate as well, or else I am too tipsy this morning hour. When you say \"SQ doesn\\'t have to pay for some of the wines they serve in F,\" my interpretation would be a free wine served in F by one of the chateau or something like that. But who can afford giving out $150 wine for each flight for the whole year? I would be so surprise if the winery does that. How can it survives financially?

       "  'reply': \" Okay, let me try to clarify. This post is dedicated to both of you, dearest SQ LPP and Sqstalker: Yes, from what I have heard, some of the wines they served in First Class was F.O.C. to the airline in exchange for the publicity received in the air. Originally posted by SQ LPP But who can afford giving out $150 wine for each flight for the whole year? I would be so surprise if the winery does that. How can it survives financially? As to how long the deal was, how can the chateau survive giving away (so much) free products, and the economic impact to the chateau itself: I have no information about those. For example, if it was a limited time, it may be manageable for the chateau. Another possibility is that they negotiated with the chateau AFTER the selection by the wine panel is finalized. Another thing to note is that a USD150 bottle of wine is only a USD150 bottle of wine to you (the customer), but not the chateau. But fact is it was done and perhaps is still being done. Do realize, from the beginning I did not say that it is a negative thing about SQ. Both of you made it seems like it is a very negative issue & cost cutting etc., which I don't understand why. I am actually just amazed at the marketing prowess of our favorite airline. PS: You misread the '' this time. It was not you. \"},\n",

       "  'reply': ' I think what StarG is talking about happens with some airlines and the food they serve onboard. The airline (or catering company) will of course get a bulk discount but presumably there\\'s some additional benefit (heavily discounted or even free produce maybe) in featuring prominently the name of the brand in the menu. An example (for BA - not SQ) is the olive oil served in F.

Of course CX only serves 1 champagne Krug in F and SQ , 2. I don't know... All I do know is CX's Lynch Bages is famously popular. I stilll have a bottle of '92 somewhere courtesy of an empty CX F flight a few years ago! Haven't got enough experience in F to speak about the wines. From memory, CX served William Deutz Cuvee on some routes and Krug on others. SQ serves both DP and Krug long haul, and only DP on the shorter regional routes. CX wines can be rather hit/miss in J though, SQ whilst predictable is rather dependable. As for the fizz I find it pretty bizarre how CX serves the v delicious party in a mouth, Billecart-Salmon NV (seriously, I'd drink this over DP!!) on its regional routes other than NRT yet offer the paint stripper Champagne Deutz on its long hauls plus NRT! I do realise these things are YMMV but Deutz has been massively unpopular with everyone I've spoken to, even the most ardent CX fans. Surely you'd want to serve the good stuff on your premier routes. SQ serves Charles Heidsieck Mis En Cave which is pretty good as far as NVs go though some of the disgorgements can be rather 'green.' For the best onboard wine list though - I find LH truly a class act in F! And NZ and QF rather solid in J when it comes to the reds and whites, with NZ and CX regional coming out tops for J fizz with the Laurent Perrier NV and Billecart respectively. YMMV of course. \"},\n",

Pan-fried fillet of beef in three peppercorn sauce with garden vegetables and roasted potatoes 2. Artichoke-tomato crusted loin of lamb in thyme sauce, French beans with bacon, and gratin potatoes 3. Salmon gratinated with feta and parmesan cheese in orange ginger sauce with vegetables and Mississippi rice 4. Honey glazed duckling with vegetables and Chinese egg noodles My favorite from FRA is always the lamb. Somehow the crust of artichoke and tomato creates a different taste of the lamb. And yes, I love French beans. Second choice would be the beef. It\\'s just because it\\'s European meat. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 876 SIN - TPE C I will be pretty stuffed from the FRA-SIN flight before but I will try to eat everything I can get hehe. Here are my favorites ex-Singapore: 1. Roast lamb chops with mint jus, mesclun salad, and thyme-flavoured gratin potatoes 2. 6 oz. U.S. rib-eye steak with creamy green peppercorn sauce, roasted vegetables, and garlic-mashed potatoes 3. Pan-seared Chilean bass with bouillabaisse sauce, capsicum confit, and kalamata olive potato I like the lamb, once again. Beef as the second option. But if I want to be a pita on board, i.e. decide to have the choice from the menu, I will get the beef for the BTC, and will tell the FA to have the beef. It seems the crew loves the beef. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 877 TPE - SIN F My first F meal ... yum ... yumm ... yummmmmm ! Ex-Taipei ... a hard one so I thought about not BTC\\'ing except there is something I absolutely cannot miss taipeiflyer should be the best person to give an advice for ex-TPE whether to BTC or not to BTC. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 12 SIN - NRT F 1. Roast rack of lamb with mint jus, mesclun salad, and thyme-flavoured gratin potatoes 2. Lobster Thermidor with buttered asparagus, slow-roasted vine-ripened tomato, and saffron rice 3. Pan-fried veal loin and braised veal cheek with parsnip purée, garden vegetables, and sautéed mushrooms Again, I always order the lamb or the beef personally. As I mention many times, not fond of lobster thermidor ex-SIN due to the flood of mushrooms on the sauce. In the past year, I have not ordered chicken rice as BTC since it seems the BTC chicken rice is too dry. Also, SQ12 departs after 9am. I will enjoy heavy breakfast at the lounge such as dim sum or noodle soups. I will get my fix of chicken rice while I am in transit in Singapore. And yes, the meals served onboard SQ12 SIN-NRT would be about lunch time. Thus, I want something a bit heavier which lamb or beef will serve me well. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 12 NRT - LAX F 1. Lobster Thermidor with buttered zucchini, carrots, and pilaff rice with mixed peppers 2. Pan-fried sea bass wrapped with potato, served with red-vinegar sauce and white beans Thanks a lot! Jhm is right on the dot. (No.. it is not dot dot dot ) I love beef sukiyaki ex-NRT. It\\'s not really a soup. It is something like sauce. Anyhow, you may try to have lobster thermidor ex-NRT. So far, it is always the best I had. But if on the menu there is kuro buta (pork) I will keep my BTC for the meals prior to land at LAX. Lastly, it would be great help if others have posted the menu for your flights. It will be helpful in deciding whether to BTC or not. '},\n",

Thx (and I\\'m at 3 weeks and counting \\'til blastoff) . --mcz I am confused with your statement about \"it is all or nothing.\" From my experience (well unless everything has changed in the 10 months) For SQ11 LAX-NRT-SIN you will be able to have the BTCs: Lunch Light meal (prior to land at NRT) Dinner (for NRT-SIN segment) Thus, you don\\'t need to have the same thing, i.e. Japanese meals, for those three meals service (if my interpretation of what you wrote being all the way to SIN). From the regular menu (look at the sample of previous menu in the SQ F menu thread) the Japanese menu is always available, in addition to the international menu. Thus, I personally will not do a BTC for kyo-kaiseki on SQ11. Another reason is also the fact that I don\\'t think LAX catering would be a great one to make a kyo-kaiseki. Ex-NRT, for dinner, as I previously mentioned, the lobster thermidor tastes better IMHO, and if there is kuro buta or wagyu beef on the menu, it would be a better choice. Again, for your return on SQ12, I don\\'t agree with doing a BTC for chicken karaage. But that\\'s just me who is a bit fussy and picky in eating. '},\n",

I have not flown ex-TPE for a very long time. Thus, unable to answer your first BTC opinion. For the second one, in my opinion, you need to have an acquired taste for yam rice. I myself think it\\'s kind of strange to have tiny cube yams mixed with rice. I love yam, but usually only certain yams which are boiled, steamed fried. You may try and you can let us know what you think! But here is the picture from one of my flight where I was the biggest pita of all. I had BTC for the steak. I told the crew that I opted not to have the steak but picked from regular menu. And I would give my BTC to the crew to enjoy. But the crew decided to offer the steak to the only other fellow pax in F, which was gladly accepted. Duck yam rice was in one of the choices on the menu. I mentioned to the LS that I don\\'t like the yam rice due to the taste of the yam mixed in the rice. But I will just have the duck which came with yam rice, and had steamed rice instead. Guess what? The LS removed all the yam pieces from the yam rice so that I could have the taste of the rice that had been cooked with yam. Here you go! Yes it was a good tasty rice! Yummy especially with those moist boiled nuts on the side, '},\n",

Lamb does sound like a good choice, although there is always the worry that it will be overcooked (Even in Suites...). That old favourite, Lobster Thermidor, is on the list. What I find interesting is that while the dish appears in various BTC menus, the source of lobster in this case is NZ lobster, whereas ex-SIN or ex-USA is is Boston Lobster. '},\n",

For supper - provided they have enough, they may offer you one of the on-board meals. Beware though - your lobster may not taste very good by then. If your flight only has breakfast served.... well, too bad. But I find their Nasi Lemak and Bryani fairly decent, if you like local dishes. \"},\n",

VLML for SQ215 was a big disappointment as the pasta dish was very dry and bland. But heard that the fish was very good. The VLML meal for SQ216 was superb. It consist of 3 patty of don't know what substance. Think Perth catering is of higher quality than SATS. \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" Some notes I wrote this morning regarding a wine frequently served in SQ First Class (and seen on many lists posted above)... SQ has been serving Chateau Cos d'Estournel in F for a couple of years at least, maybe many more. I'm a proud fan of California wines, so I typically just ask for the American Cabernet when I get to my entree, typically beef. I often have a New World chardonnay with the first course. Well, I'm (dangerously) starting to get into Bordeaux. And wouldn'tchaknowit, when I went to the grocery store yesterday, they had the Cos right there in the wine cellar, and at a decent price too. So I figured, why not give it a try and see if I like it? A preview, hopefully, for my next SQ 001. After some consideration, I picked it up and had it with cheese last night after dinner. (See? I really do this on the ground too, not just in the air!) As expected, when I opened it, it was very tight and tannic. But after an hour in the decanter, it had opened up nicely, as expected. Tannins had smoothed out nicely, the earthiness-smokiness typical of Bordeaux had come through, though not with the power of some bigger Chateaux. An hour further (by this time, we had gotten through about half of it), and it had opened up even more, a distinct black cherry flavor could be found and some vanilla too. So I resolved... If SQ has it on SQ 001 when I fly in a couple of months, I'll definitely forego the California--unless it's one I absolutely adore--in favor of the Cos. But, I will ask the Singapore Boys to open the bottle and pour me a glass right after takeoff and serve it with my Singapore Sling. I won't drink the wine until we've progressed to the entree--BTC beef, most likely--but that should give the wine at least a bit of time to oxygenate. At the oxygen levels of a Megatop in flight, it will need quite a bit of time. \"},\n",

If you don't call ahead, or the requirement is based merely out of personal preferences, they'll obviously see what they could do, but no guarantees.

So perhaps Mr. H can handle full dinner service meals and 2 or 3 hours later have Yu Pian Mi Fen. I tried this dish before. Like noodle soup right? (If my memory serves me right.) SQ 853 HKG-1330 SIN-1720 (Lunch Service) Why not trying the Chinese set menu onboard? Have you tried it before? I know the catering uploads limited amount, but if you can convey the message to the LSS or LS that you really want to try shi quan shi mei they might hold one for you. The sample of the menu is like this. Last time I bought roast goose from HKG and had some on board in addition to the main course I had. SQ 318 SIN-1255 LHR-1855 (Lunch and Light Meal) This one is a bit tricky. It used to be lunch and dinner prior to arrival in London. But now it\\'s light meal. Here is an example of the menu. What I will do if I take this flight is to order \"heavy\" meal for the light meal. For me, chicken curry peranakan is fulfilling enough, but many friends of mine would say the beef or rack of lamb would be better choice. Regarding kyo-kaiseki, I don\\'t find it as a good choice ex-SIN. I don\\'t know why, but seems too cold and not tasty. (Well, hopefully nickbots can post what they did in their flight SQ318 last July before it became A380. '},\n",

       "  'reply': \" Thanks for the good advice. I confess when I first opened the HKG menu link I didn't scroll down and wondered what I was missing. Second try and I spotted it. I will certainly go for the shi quan shi mei. Is it guaranteed that they'll have it or should I book the abalone just in case? I'll also think again about the kyo kaiseki - perhaps try the laksa instead. But the chicken curry peranakan sounds like a good one to go for. I still intend to eat heartily in the city before the MEL flight. I have five hours layover and I count food as one of the real joys of travelling. I'd much rather forego the SQ luxury and have a good Peranakan meal or eat at the Tekka Centre hawker market or eat a mutton curry with my fingers instead. These are things I simply can't do in Edinburgh. Singapore is one of my favourite cities and it's a shame that most tourists don't look beneath the surface. It would be criminal to be half way around the world and not enjoy their (your?) wonderful food. Maybe I'll sleep on the plane, maybe I won't, but I should be shattered after a very early start from DEL! Gosh, I wish I were rich and could do this more often! \"},\n",

That's why you should inquire nicely about it to the crew first. And yes, you still can BTC and tell the crew that you would rather forgo the BTC because the shi quan shi mei looks more appetising. Indeed, even for 3 or 4 hours I always try to have some local foods. (Many SQTalkers here have seen me crazy in eating certain local favorites! Even more snacks to carry on board as well. ) But again, my body clock has always been ready for the full dinner service such as on your flight time frame (took SIN-SYD or SIN-AKLmany times). Thus, I was not completely forgo the SQ F hospitality! Perhaps you will not get shattered on flight, but have more spirits to stay awake enjoying the excellent service from the crew.

Same list as shown in the web. It's similar to SQ11 LAX-NRT which serves lunch and light meals as well. In the menu, the light bites are the snack service between two meals. Light bites offer noodle soup, sandwiches and snacks stuff. I have never done a doggie bag except for the cakes. I think looking at the time of arrival, you are better off having the curry peranakan or laksa prior to land. It would be good to complete the experience onboard SQ. \"},\n",

Yes you can BTC for light meals but portion size won\\'t be much of a difference from the portion you\\'d get for the light meal main course. Of course if you ask which I prefer, I would prefer a \"full meal\" as a broader range of variety never hurts.

       "  'reply': \" Just a few BTC questions; flying out MEL (suites)-SIN-FRA-JFK return next week and just wanted to know: 1) The lobster out of MEL...can't find any pics or reports of this. Any good? The BTC options ex MEL don't seem particularly appealing, so I'll stick with the Lobster unless someone tells me it's terrible. 2)Ex SIN: So many options. I don't want red meat for supper, so I've ordered the Chillian seabass....is this good? Again, not many reports of this dish; people seem to always go for the beef or lamb or lobster. Also, for breakfast, I am having the Yu Pian Mei Fen as I remember this dish fondly from childhood..has anyone ever tried it here on BTC F? Also, has anyone tried the papardelle with seafood? Is it good? It sounded interesting but i didn't want to see seafood and pasta drowning in a cream sauce. 3)Ex FRA: Like MEL, quite a limited selection. Was going to go with the lobster (boring), but changed to the roasted Veal Knuckle with bavarian bread dumplings. Has anyone had this? Sounds hearty and local. 4) Ex JFK: Quite a few good options. This one I really can't decide. I ordered the long Island Duck in natural jus. Any good? I am also equally torn with the other 2 contenders: Roasted sea bass with wilted spinach and glazed crab-mashed potatoes and Grilled shrimps and scallops in tarragon mustard sauce with leeks, carrots, and linguini Having agonised over these choices...I'm a sucker for lobster, no matter what it looks like, so if any of the above choices are not that good, tell me and i will gravitate to the default setting.

       "  'reply': \" BTC seabass ex-SIN is great, I've done it two or three times. The only problem with it now is that if you're flying F or R, you get access to TPR. And guess what fish figures prominently on the menu? Yep. Seabass. Booyah... so it defeats the purpose of ordering BTC seabass now for me. I just have it in TPR as a snack first. And especially flying R, it's a nice appetiser! You can even try asking for a double lobster, like someone's infamous multi-foie gras burger here and set a new record... I doubt the lobster ex-SIN is bigger than the lobster ex-MEL. You should see the last few I had... could be mistaken for a slightly overgrown prawn! Speaking of which, you can do unlimited lobsters in TPR. Which again defeats the purpose of having it in BTC. So, I'd go for something you can't get in TPR, like a yummy Kyo-Kaiseki (unfortunately this tends to be exactly the same little tidbits the last couple of times, some variation would be welcome!) My 2 cents... \"},\n",

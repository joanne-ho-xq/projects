I know, sounds crazy, but I'm on a mileage run. Being a *G, I understand that I can enter the KF Gold lounges (EYCL BP). Are the two KF G lounges ideal for overnighting? Or am I better off at the transit hotel? Thing is, I'm having problems with my credit card and can't make a reservation so I'm worried it'll be full when I do a walk-in booking. IIRC they are 24 hours but do yourself a favour an get a room at the transit hotel. Your chances are higher at T1 for a walk-in. You don't even get to shower at the KF Gold lounges. At least at the hotel you get a real bed, some privacy and your own washroom. Plus, you get to take a dip at the T1 rooftop pool. \"},\n",

I undertand that KrisGold are entitled to clubhouse entry when flying on Virgin but not sure what the position is when the lounges are operated by third parties. I cannot find anything about this on SQTalk or articles on web only seem to refer directly to clubhouses. I am flying on VS from Del to LHR. Virgin Atlantic lists the Plaza Premium Lounge as its lounge at Delhi Airport. As a KrisGold flying on Virgin will I be entitled to access to the Plaza Premium Lounge at Del? Will I also be entitled to any other benefits such as priority check in or luggage? It is really difficult to stay within *A when flying India to LHR without extending the flight time by going through the *A hubs in places such as Germany, Austria or Switzerland. '},\n",

From the latest PPS Club News: Lets hope they completely redesign the SKL F side at T3 as that lounge is so underwhelming/boring/crap (for an F lounge) that it's ridiculous for a flagship lounge. Dear Mr MAN Flyer, As a PPS Club member, your every journey on Singapore Airlines is designed for greater comfort. Now, we have gone to even greater lengths to bring you the comfort of home in our new-concept SilverKris Lounge in Sydney. The new SilverKris Lounge was conceptualised by renowned architectural and interior design firm ONG&ONG, following extensive research that included focus groups with customers. The lounge features a customized screen, with a batik design signature of Singapore Airlines\\x92 unique heritage. It also picks up on some familiar elements of home \\x96 including a cosy living room area and private spaces for rest and relaxation. Unwind in the distinctive SIA armchair, or work in the privacy of specially designed productivity pods. The taste of home is never far away, wherever home may be \\x96 with Singapore favourites such as laksa and mee siam, as well as a selection of fine cuisine from around the world. An array of beverages, including premium wine and spirits, are also available for your choosing. And you can always be assured of the warmth and care of our friendly staff, who are on hand to assist you with your travel needs. Over the next five years, this new design will be introduced to SilverKris Lounges in 15 cities. Planning is underway to upgrade lounges in London, Hong Kong, and Singapore (Terminal 3) next year. We look forward to welcoming you on board again soon, and to your home away from home at the new-concept SilverKris Lounge in Sydney. Yours sincerely, Shirlene Teo Manager Loyalty Marketing \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" As part of a trip to Europe and the USA in June this year, I visited the SilverKris Lounge in SFO. This lounge is smallish, but no smaller than the lounges operated by many other non-USA based airlines at SFO. Apart from seating and work areas, there was a buffet with a limited selection of hot and cold dishes, as well as a self service bar area. This lounge has good views of the tarmac. Refreshments... The lounge also served a Singapore specialty, mee siam... It was fairly full when I was there. Overall impressions... A comfortable but unexceptional lounge with what you would expect from a lounge in an overseas location, but not offering any more than the basics. I would have thought that a flagship destination like SFO would have a larger, more impressive lounge (Look at Sydney, for example). Perhaps there are space constraints at SFO. I for one would probably head for the United Club the next time (or check out any of the other A* lounges in SFO), simply because it is much larger, even if the catering or beverage selection isn't as large. \"},\n",

UA lounge looks quite old with only cold food and some hot (western) soup. See here for SFO UA club food offerings. Only SKL has showers and no proper queue system IIRC. I just got the towel from the reception, then waited near one of the shower. Then it becomes first come first serve basis, or after whoever is nearby and has a towel and was there before me. Shower was not cleaned after each use. EVA lounge was also very full during SQ1 hours. I only remembered that EVA lounge has wings.

       "  'reply': ' ======================== Some comments: 1. Generally, I was not particularly wowed by it. It struck me as just an ordinary lounge with each part slightly upgraded, for example the food offering slightly improved compared to other normal lounges. There was no innovation of any sort, a-la-VS CH or FRA FCT etc, or even the HKG Wing F section (gosh, how old is that lounge?) 2. I did witness some degree of the \"eager attendants\" syndrome, although nowhere near as bad as some others have indicated. However, I found it striking that they really spoke no English at all - couldn\\'t they have paid a bit more for attendants who could also actually help you find things like such as a fork? 3. The shower room was pretty good, though I had a feeling of deja-vu from lounges as old as the circa-2000 \"new\" UA RCC at NRT. Thankfully the temperature and water pressure was fine despite some reports to the contrary. As a lounge, it\\'s fine - I mean, there\\'s nothing really to \"fault\" it as such. However, considering that this is the year 2008, and the SKL F at T2 opened eons ago, it seems to me that nothing has improved in real terms at all - in fact, I would go as far as to say the new SKL is far behind the current generation of lounges, whereas the SKL T2 at the time of opening was probably quite ground-breaking. Obviously SQ has quite a number of F passengers and TPPs ex-SIN so you can\\'t really have LH-style FCT without it getting totally ridiculous, but you would have thought that the VS CH at LHR would have been a viable model to aim for...

       "  'reply': \" Hello everybody! As a Dutch based traveller i usually find the information about SQ-activities in the Netherlands quite non-excistent on the internet so i decided to start doing some posts here about SQ in the Netherlands and about my upcoming SQ travel. I will travel the 17th december 2008 on SQ 323 in business class (J) so i will have access to the SKL Amsterdam. I've been there before twice: 1) when i was about 10 yrs old, my mom knew the checkin supervisor when SQ still had their own ground staff in Amsterdam. She managed to received an invitation for her family into the SKL even though flying in Y without any FFP-status 2) when graduated from senior high, i got the choice of a Breitling watch or flying as chaperone with grandma on SQ from AMS-SIN-SOC in Rafless Class vv. as a graduation present. Needless to say my natural curiosity about what happens behind the curtain when it closes inflight made me choose instantly for the latter option! Unfortunatly it was the age of no digital cameras so i don't have any pictures of it! SQ website gives this as information about SKL Amsterdam: http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...es/skl_ams.jsp Welcome to SilverKris Lounge - Amsterdam Take a break from your travels - come and enjoy our SilverKris Lounge. Take advantage of the following: A well-equipped business centre Phone lines for laptop Internet access A wide variety of hot and cold drinks and premium alcoholic beverages A self-service food buffet, including instant noodles, fruit salads, Dutch cookies, and nuts Location Amsterdam Schiphol Airport First Level Between Pier F and E (Airside) Major Facilities Internet Access Luggage Area TV Area Lounge Access (based on departing flight) First Class Business Class Singapore Airlines PPS Club, Solitaire Singapore Airlines PPS Elite Gold, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Star Alliance Gold (please refer to respective membership guides for access conditions) Opening Hours Daily: 0750 to 1150 hours (subject to flight schedule changes) Recalling from my mermories i still remember: 1) Both times the loungedragon was the same tall almost giant blond elder woman who was very friendly in both english and dutch. She asked every guest if she can show the facilities and i did remember she made flight announcments. 2) During my first stay i noticed a very tall decorated christmas tree and christmas adornements across the lounge (we were traveling in the x-mas season then) 3) It's kind of a hike to the SKL when travelling with grandma. It took at least a 15 min walk and ellevator usage because it is on the 2nd level of terminal 3 departures. SQ usually departs from the G-gates which is in elderly terms almost walking the marathon from the SKL. Luckly the lounge dragon called forth a chariot (the cart) so we were driven off to our gate 4) The entrance looks dark but the SilverKris logo is immensely lit-up visible behing the lounge dragon's desk 5) Drinks included alchoholic as far as i remember Bailey's, Grand Marnier and red / white wine. Softdrinks were available canned from the fridges. Water was bottled in Evian and Perrier. Napkins and wedges of lemons were available. Coffee and hot water were available from machines as well as an assortiment of different tea bag flavours. All was self-service. Cutlery surprisingly was of First Class; the heavy silver/steel like ones. (I still have some in drawers at home, i was allowed to take those when i asked politly kinda embarrassed) 6) Foodwise, Dutch stroopwafels and other biscuits were available and instant cupnoodles. I can't remember clearly if sandwiches were offered but i do know no hot foods were available. (As SQ leaves mornings from AMS and the Dutch usually have a continental breakfast, hot foods would be kind of a waste) 7) Lounge had dark blue sofas, 4 grouped around a round table. Toilettes are available inside the lounge and the handtowels were soft fluffy ones and not of the brown recyclable sawdust paper variety at Amsterdam airport. The 17th December 2008 i will visit this lounge again with mr. Allegro25 Sr. Are there any special requests or details i should photograph, observe, ask, try, write about etc. for you guys? I know Amsterdam is only a secondary EU-destination city so this SKL might not be visited that often by others but nevertheless i still think it deserves to be spotlighted. Moreover after a quick search on google i found out SQ is the ONLY star alliance carrier with its own lounge at AMS making it automatic the only *G lounge available at Ams. If internet is available i will try to post directly from the lounge itself on the 17th. \"},\n",

Originally posted by fimo View Post Same here, the SKL there may not be much to write home about, but I'll take AMS over most other major EU gateways in a heartbeat! My last experience at AMS was embarassing.... I disembarked from a SQ flight, one of the first to be out of the plane. There were immigration officers at the end of the aerobridge. Stopped me and ask to look at my passport. The first officer opened the passport, saw that I had many stamps, EU and others in the pages, began taking a closer look. He then passed it on to another more senior officer, who was really scrutinising it, even with magnifying glass, on the photgraph page. Stood there for half an hour, with them questioning me as to the reasons for the frequent trips etc etc, I was not even going into Holland, it was a transit stop. I was in a hurry too as i have a next flight to catch..... passengers who were disembarking were staring at me, wondering what criminal offence I had committed etc etc... pissed off. One time I had to catch a flight from Amsterdam, I took a train from Antwerp to the airport. Going through security, I was stopped and was given a thorough search, with dogs....damned.... I don't know, but Amsterdam is not the airport for me..... maybe I have this oriental drug courier look...... try as much, I will avoid Amsterdam unless necessary. \"},\n",

I'm on SQ2 HKG-SFO (10:45PM departure) in about a month and I need to check out of my hotel by 12PM (well I can request a 4PM checkout but I need to dramatize my reply don't I ) Anyway, a shower is a must for F passengers on such a long flight. This is actually pretty outrageous. But for me it actually gets even worse since I need to take a connecting flight to Miami (AA272). Since there is no arrival lounge at SFO (or any lounge for that matter) I won't shower for over 24 hours... Sshhh... \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" I visited the renovated lounge for the first time today. I must say that I'm disappointed with the changes. The positives are the ambience feels better and not so dated; and the lounge size is greatly expanded, almost doubled. But to me, the negatives outweigh. As pointed out, there's no shower facilities - heck, they do not even have toilet facilities. You have to go next door to the public toilet. This is a major letdown. I also wonder whether its necessary to have such a large space. The lounge is less than 30% full during the few hours I was in transit here. I also feel let down by the First Class section. SIA carved off a small space (accounting for say, <20% of total space) for First Class sitting. But the ventilation in that area is poor - it feels stuffy. Its also a long walk from the common food / buffet area. So you're better off sitting in the common area. The magazine racks are also poorly designed. You have to stoop very very low to discern the title of the magazines. I do not see any difference in the variety of food, compared to the old SKL. But the main grouse I have will be the lack of toilet and shower facility. What I did was that I went to the Thai and United Airlines lounge near Gate 60 for a shower. Its a 10 minute detour each way - but if you need to freshen up, at least there's still a place (far away) you can go. \"},\n",

It also has (or had) a non-Schengen section at the very end which is/was used by LH and EW primarily. There were some issues with Terminal A in that the LH lounges are located in the Schengen area of Terminal A and SQ were issuing letters to all passengers with lounge access reminding them to allow minimum times to pass through immigration. I think the design of DUS is the issue with the gate crowding as the A gates were similarly problematic. The ends of the piers have a square footprint but connect planes onto the corners, whereas most airports use some kind of circular or polygonal expansion in floor space to facilitate that. '},\n",

Originally posted by kapitan View Post Is there a smoking room in the lounge, there was one previously....... kapitan, sorry to be the bearer of bad news...there is no smoking room. Quick overview then...it has a *G sign outside, so should be open to pax on other *A carriers. As stargold mentioned, it has no separate F section. It is surprisingly roomy and airy compared to the OZ J/*G lounge, with apron views. Two thirds of the lounge are 'open roofed', with the remaining third tucked away and feeling a little more cozy...and closer to the restrooms and showers. Of everything there seems to be pairs: two unisex showers (sans toilets, spacious and light though), two gents sinks, two gents pissoirs, two gents toilets...a choice of two sandwiches, two buffet mains, two snacks, two WiFi access points...there is a choice of three cheeses and four beers though. No champagne, no cognac...but Bombay Sapphire is available. And lots more drinks to choose from. Chilean red and white wine, Cava, Campari, Bacardi, Absolut, and Chivas. Pepsi, not Coke. I personally prefer the catering and showers (avec toilets) in the KE lounge...the drink quality and food quality (catered by Hyatt Incheon) are just better. Drink selection is much smaller though. Reading material for English speakers is better at the SKL though... Makes a case for lounge hopping with PP. And dang, it's pretty fresh throughout ICN airport today...wish I didn't pack my jacket away in SHE. Update: just tried the showers...way better than the OZ or KE concourse ones. Makes the SKL my new favorite concourse lounge. Let's hope the catering gets improved a lil. And if the lounge feels cold, head to tucked away part. Much warmer in there. Update 2: the lounge is located on the KE lounge and transfer desk side...it's a slightly longer walk to the *A transfer desk and gates. \"},\n",

I was fortunate last Sunday my TG flight left from gate F1 so I managed the EVA lounge directly upstairs and overlooking there and it, too, is miles better than those crappy, dirty, sticky, poorly maintained TG lounges. I do agree with you, my worry is that it will take those knowing TG passengers away from TGs own lounges and become the busiest in the place for now. \"},\n",

I don't think the issue is with separate lounges - it's how SQ perceives Star Gold as inferior to Business. Lufthansa has separate Senator and Business Lounges at their hubs, and while I have not been to their Business Lounges, the Senator Lounges (for Star Gold) are far superior to the equivalent Star Gold lounges at SQ's home base in Singapore. In fact, LH allows Star Gold to use their First Class check-in counters (not the First Class Terminal though) whereas for SQ Star Gold is lumped with Business Class check-in. \"},\n",

So if you want to take nice pics of the lounge, go in the afternoon and not at night when it is so crowded. I thought only Krisflyer Gold or Star alliance gold cardmembers can enter the KF G lounge but wanted to try and enter to have a look and I asked if I can go in and showed my J boarding pass and she let me in...so happy! The food at T2's SKL Business Class section is really bad and not much variety compared to KF G's and T3's for lunch. The standard is really bad in T2, no more Haagen Daz ice-cream either. KG G's and T3's SKL Business Class section's food is so much better. SKL in T2 is indeed scary - they cut everything. I am surprised there are still fish in the fish tanks. SKL in T3 has seen cutting of all juices to orange and apple only. \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post Just newly opened and was curious to see how HKG would compare to SYD. Result: No comparison, Sydney wins hands down. The lounge is pretty small and doesn't display the elegance of the Sydney one. Yes, you will find elements of the new concept but it's more like how do I get ten different things in a room that has only space for five? Not a surprise. It was obvious what 'kit' they would put in there, but it's a new location it needs more than anything else. Staff here is incredibly uninspired and unmotivated - no pride in offering a new lounge, zero customer service attitude, no smile on record. To make matters worse, no supervisor around and absolutely no interest in how people like the lounge or service. Disappointing. That's a shame, and totally different to the SYD staff when the SKL there reopened. My sister was in there straight after it reopened and she said the staff made a hell of a fuss of them and were asking them what they thought of everything in there.

Once you reach the top of the escalator, you will see lots of DFS goods strewn all over the place. It's a packing and delivery zone for all DFS purchases. It's a mess, and isnt the most welcoming scene before you reach the lounge. It's the same situation for OZ's Central Business Class lounge. Fortunately, the entrance to the lounge is across an overhead bridge and away from the mess. Entrance Batik motifs on the ceiling leading to the lounge. Rest of the lounge was bright and spacious. It did get a little crowded as the evening passed, but seats remained plentiful (but this could be because the load on SQ603 was quite light that night) Food was very good and beautifully presented. Better than SKL MNL, but not as varied as LHR. Overall a much better place to relax before your flight compared to the OZ lounge. \"},\n",

Marketing Bumpf from LH As of the beginning of April 2008, a Senator Café is available to you at Munich Airport in the EU departure area of terminal 2. The modern 150m² café and bar equipped with 48 seats offers you another area to work and relax in, in addition to the space currently provided by the Senator Lounge. The atmosphere conveys warmth and hospitality, and a barista guarantees professional and custom-prepared coffee enjoyment. When you're just a little hungry, there are light snacks as well as healthy fruit smoothies and salads available on the way to the gate. With this new concept, Lufthansa is starting extensive modernization and expansion measures for the current EU lounges in Munich, which will be finished by the end of 2009. The Senator Café is centrally located near Gate G27 across from the current Senator Lounge, and is open daily from 5am to 10pm. \"},\n",

(Obviously it'll be easier to lounge hop within the same terminal.) Our favourite Fauchon was served in the old NRT SKL prior to June 2006. Now, NH F and C lounges serve Fauchon as well, but IMHO they are different quality (and no green tea). AFAIK, QPP with NH C BP will only be able to use the C lounge. And I think all NH flights are departing from the same Terminal now as UA, LH, TG and SQ. The only other *A lounge would be UA RCC for C BP. \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" I was in the ANA lounge (J, 2/F) yesterday from 9-9:45am. Tried the Fauchon ice cream (Earl Grey) for the first time. I liked it because I've never had this flavor before, but the ice cream quality is nothing special. IMO, Ben & Jerry's & Haagen Dazs have better & creamier ice cream. I noticed that at 9:30am, there's a changeover of food items: out came trays of sandwiches and sushi (not an extensive selection, only inari and futomaki-like rolls, but I love inari). I also noticed that the Japanese businessmen like drinking: even at 9am, I saw a lot of them downing glasses of beer, and some were having whiskey & other mixed drinks. (This is just an objective & neutral observation and not any kind of criticism or compliment.) Nice lounge, overall, though much more crowded than the UA RCC at this hour. (Apparently it's quiet at the UA RCC in the mornings.) \"},\n",

As CGK and others have said the Fauchon served in the NH lounges isn't the same as what was served in the SKL I have to agree that the product in the NH lounge isn't what we all raved about, but bring back the stuff from the SKL and we have a different story. \"},\n",

It\\'s a huge area. It was told that going forward there will no longer be a smoking area and the entire space is being utilized for the SQ different lounges. '},\n",

I have banged on enough about my dislike of windowless/dark lounges, no matter how good the facilities, but this place has huge floor to ceiling windows and is very bright and airy. It does get the sun shining straight in during the afternoon so they have got blinds as well. There are four or five staff serving in here, which was a bit much initially as I was the only one in for a while. There is a number of hot and cold food items and they also give you a TPR style menu where you can order stuff from the kitchen. Slightly bizarrely there is a (wo)manned bar in the J side but not in the F side, although that is covered by all the staff who get the drinks for you. There is a small 'island' with the buckets containing white wines, prosecco and champagne, which is Laurent Perrier for those who care about these things. I could not agree more - such a pleasant lounge! great views, lovely shower with decent toiletries, the familiar laksa and btw the gin is Hendricks for those who care about these things! \"},\n",

The shower facility was pretty cramp. Level 1 had about 20 sofa seats and about 8 2-seater dining tables. It had quite an extensive choice of self-service liquor. The buffet line wasn't too bad, with mostly Indian and middle-eastern fare, so sashimi and simple sushi. Lots of bread and cheese selection, plus a good fruit counter. There were also a few items on a menu that one can order from including dimsum items (halal of course). Level 2 is a smoking area that contained a similar number of sofa seats, including about 3-4 massage chairs. It also had a buffet with a simpler selection of food and drinks.

       "  'reply': \" Honestly, would love to have more bells and whistles in SKL. But let me add some input from a different angle. I believe SQ also has a lot of homework to do (effort and money to spend) just on improving consistency of their SKLs around the world. For example, why should the SFO SKL be so much more mediocre than others? They do have a nice shower, but they shoot themselves in the foot a bit because despite the shower, they won't even carry tooth brushes, though they did before. You're gonna spend millions on revamping some lounges, but cut costs on toothbrushes from some lounges (and not others)? Does that make sense? So inconsistent! And more importantly, the food and drink offerings and the atmosphere are drab. For its non-SKL lounges too there are some real duds. The Miro lounge at BCN, for example. Really, the offering is quite basic. A few mini sandwiches and some sodas and drinks laid out at a bar. When I was there, it was not kept tidy or refreshed, probably because it was undermanned. Used plates everywhere, empty food platters at the self serve bar. I was traveling in F too, that time, making it seem even more ridiculous. Though even in J (or even maybe Y), why would a basic and dirty lounge be appealing? \"},\n",

That would be a rather strange marketing perspective to adopt. Why would the SKL be the brand that is being optimized? The relevant brands are SQ First Class, SQ Business Class and SQ Economy Class. Your reasoning seems as if it would justify the price premium of SQ First over SQ Business by telling a traveller that his FC experience begins at checkin, gets interrupted at the lounge, and then re-starts at boarding. That would simply be bizarre. (But having a website not be fully functional after more than a year since launch is also bizarre, so I guess anything's possible these days.) \"},\n",

I am traveling on UA F and decided to go to the SKL rather than the RCC (easy to understand why...) or the NZ lounge (SKL is quieter, in fact I am the only one in the lounge). When I arrived at the gate, I presented my F boarding pass and my PPS card. The young dragon told me to go in but on the J side. I said I was traveling in F, not J and that I believed I should be granted access to the F side. She opened a folder and only looked at the PPS story. Then as I protested more, she called on the senior dragon who went through the same folder and showed me the new rules for PPS (thanks, but I know them). She then went on to say that everything just changed... (I know that too, except it was about 6 weeks ago) and said \"Do you have a UA gold card?\" I said no, but that I had gold in other *A programs. She asked to see one and I pulled my LH SEN card. She then told the younger dragon to let me in. The novice dragon asked if it was to J or F. The senior dragon said: \"To the F. He\\'s traveling F and has *A gold.\" So their new understanding is that a F *A boarding pass is not enough anymore. Well, either they are totally confused or I am.

I was in there last night after 9PM and the place was packed with little or no place to sit. Another troublesome issue IMO is the location. Seems like it would be more reasonable to put it in the middle between the A and B gates rather than at the far end. I'm guessing its location might have more to do with the location of the F Check-In Lounge. Guess I'll have to revisit the SKL T3 one day to re-evaluate. It is nice to see a new lounge, but you would think they would build one that has room to grow. SQ LPP what time are you normally there? Seems rather empty during your stays.

       "  'reply': ' In KL again last week, and visited the Silver Kris Lounge in KL. How I ended up there might actually be more interesting than the lounge itself . I was on an MH ticket, but my KUL-SIN sector was a codeshare with Silkair. My business meetings in KL took place the day before. I had a couple of late conference calls in the evening, which meant I had to stay the night, before heading back to SIN the next day. I chose a slothful 11.10am departure from KUL to SIN, which meant that I could wake up at a reasonable hour, then head from the Hilton Kuala Lumpur at KL Sentral to the airport for a quick brekkie before my flight home. A quick ride on the KLIA Express got me to the airport without any fuss. As my MH codeshare ticket was operated my Silkair, I could not check in at the MAS counters at KL Sentral -- I had to head to the Silkair check-in counters at KLIA itself. After picking up my boarding pass, I was on auto-pilot and headed straight into the airside area, to the new dedicated ASEAN immigration counters. This must be one of the greatest features at KLIA! The few times I have been there since this was implemented, the other non-Malaysia queues on arrival and departure were busy, but the ASEAN lanes were free. Thumbs up! But just as I got the queue I realized that I had not yet had breakfast... As I was still in that \"no man\\'s land\" after the departure boarding pass check, and before the immigration counters, I figured I could still go back outside. I headed to the lift (escalators there only go down...) and went up one level back to the landside area. The airport security staffer checking boarding passes was surprised to see me come up the lift, as pax traffic was practically all headed the other way: down the escalator to immigration. \"Can I go outside? I want to eat breakfast before I go in.\" \"There is food inside,\" she replied. \"Yes, but I want to eat Roti Canai in the Food Garden.\"... She looked confused for a moment, then motioned for me to head out back to the airside departure area... \"Don\\'t they have roti canai in Singapore?\" she must have been thinking... Ironically once I headed to the Food Garden on Level 2, I could not find the roti canai. The stall had either closed in the last 2 weeks, or was now preparing the lunch menu, with other dishes. No roti canai in sight! I went back up to the departure level and headed airside. I would have to eat breakfast in one of the lounges... '},\n",

I am on an MH codeshare with Silkair, but I am Oneworld Sapphire\". The cheerful lounge attendant looked at my boarding pass, then said, \"Sorry sir, if you were a MAS Enrich member, you could use the lounge, but this codeshare is between MAS and Silkair, and not Oneworld, so you are not able to use the lounge. Very sorry about that, sir.\" OK, no worries then. He was totally professional and knew the rules well. I thanked him and headed to the Satellite Terminal via PeopleMover to the Silver Kris Lounge. At the Silver Kris Lounge, I whipped out my Krisflyer Gold Card, and presented my Silkair boarding pass to the staff member at the counter. \"I am on the Silkair flight to SIN, but it is an MH codeshare. Can I use the lounge?\" \"Sure, sir. Please come in. There will be no boarding announcements.\" The rules governing check-in and lounge access for code shares are totally arcane, but at least the staff at both MH and SQ lounges knew the rules well and whether or not to let you in...

I found the The T3 lounge fine for my purposes, there isnt a huge range of food but certainly enough for me to be happy and the food did change whilst I was there. The drink selection is ample for me, Im happy with that. And I found it quite peaceful, and I enjoy the open air part of the lounge with (slightly obscured) views out to the runway. The T2 lounge has the advantage of showers and a larger food selection, but it feels a lot more enclosed. '},\n",

       "  'reply': \" I was planning to take pictures of this lounge this week, but it was too crowded. The entrance I used was from H level (Non-Schengen), and I assume there is an entrance from the Schengen level as well (G level). The staff who greeted me were very nice. They explained that the border control will hold my passport during my stay, and I will go through security check before entering the lounge (behind the staff desk). Basically after you enter the entrance door above, to the right is the staff desk. To the left is the border control booth and further down a security with x-ray and metal detector. After that, far left there is a stair down, which is going to the G-level, Schengen area. The lounge is behind the staff desk. Sofas everywhere. To the left, drinks and buffet spreads. There are dining tables, or even the bistro style with high chair small long table while you work on your laptop. If you go straight ahead from behind the desk staff, you will find the usual sofa design placed in a square style. To the left there are 3 or 4 small room to work with computer. Further down, turn left, you will find the rest room, as well as a desk for the shower attendant. The staff who ask for drinks around the lounge at the time I was there were not as friendly and cheerful as in FRA. Different personality, I guess. And looks like they were not enjoying their jobs. And yes, if you are European wearing business suits, will be pampered by the staff. I noticed that others who dress casually, were not asked twice for the drinks. (I know I am an expert in observing things! ) Anyhow, I am sure I just had those not so good crew. I am sure another time will have different experience. Time will tell. I only asked for a glass of champagne. Two kind, but I could not hear what he said. I guess it's not a familiar name to my ears. Yes, there is a cold towel served as well. And for other drinks, I have no idea, since generally I don't drink. I checked the buffet area. There were some sushi and cold meats. Also two kind of hot meals, but I don't know why, somehow it was not as appealing as in FRA FCL. I did not see any menu on the table. Perhaps because I was there between 2pm to 4pm? When I went to the loo, I did not see Etro as the brand of choice. Something else. In short, this is my first time here at MUC FCL. The decor looks so familiar. Yes, a good place to wait for the flight compare to the SEN Lounge I had been to last year. And I don't think there is a view of the tarmac here. Next time, yes, I will be back to this lounge, instead of wondering around the H level terminal which I don't see any interesting shops. \"},\n",

That would make sense in terms of having a Garden view and being not too terribly far from SQ planes when they park at gates D2, D3, D4. To be honest, after I finished typing my report I left to get on my flight to SIN and it wasn\\'t that far from the \"D Gates\" where SQ flights arrive and leave from. I suppose I was frustrated more than anything else in the first instance, by nobody knowing where the lounge was. I only knew about it when I read the local newspaper in Bangkok on Tuesday. There is absolutely no signage whatsoever. Anyway, enough whining. To those familiar with the main Thai lounge, the best way to describe where the SQ lounge is, is to turn left out of the Thai lounge where the First Class lounge is and turn left again at the next junction. Keep left and wander almost to a dead end and you will see a solitary (\"cardboard cut out SQ girl) That\\'s it!! Just down and opposite the new Bangkok Airways Premium lounge. Otherwise, come out of Immigration, turn left, walk for an absolute eternity till you are almost at the end of the terminal building, go down one level using the escalators on the left. From memory, there is a First class lounge at the same facility. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t have time for a snoop. Now I know where it is, I will definitely use it over the Thai lounge. The SQ lounge is much more intimate. The Thai lounge can be an absolute zoo when it is busy. Plus the place is beginning to look a bit tatty. Enjoy '},\n",

I agree with HKG1, it's a nice place with lovely views of the outside world (why can't they all be like this...) and very friendly staff who seem rightly chuffed with the place. It's all one lounge with no split First and Raffles sides. You'd never stumble across it if you weren't looking for it. Only a couple of cardboard SQ Girls holding a basket of Orchids give any indication where it is.

You can make delicious food at reasonable cost. In fact, it is one of the things about Singapore that is so amazing -- great food can be had at tremendous bargains whether at hawker stalls or local restaurants.

And service that is attentive, courteous, pleasant and fast in service shouldn't be too hard for SQ to pull off on the ground if they can pull it off in the air. I have recently been reminded how much SQ spends in time training and re-training their FS. It is an investment that they have not been able to replicate on the ground which in many places are (am not sure if that's the case in SIN) contracted to third-parties due to costs. Hence there's a marked difference in service quality on the ground and onboard. For us on this side of the fence, we may not realise the trouble SQ goes through to get their FS to the quality we enjoy fairly consistently on every flight. Yes, you're right that cost containment should not necessarily mean bad service, food and experience. Hence their challenge is the proverbial how to do more with less which requires a lot of creative thinking and execution - not easy for some managers. So presumably when the order comes from the top to cut expense by X percent, the easiest thing to do is look at what you can just slash ... from small things like removing flight boards from the lounge (assume that have to pay Changi for it) and delaying refurbishing lounges which is a big ticket item. \"},\n",

I believe the basic training is 15-16 weeks and only 2 weeks of that is safety. And if I am not mistaken, training for other airlines is half as long for the next airline (someone who knows this better than I, please chime in!). All that time training is serious money and truly an investment, as you say. But, shouldn't one expect that having such top in-flight service history, experience, institutional knowledge and culture already in the company mean that it could somehow be easily tapped for uses on the ground?

I think the issue with SQ F/TPR lounges in general is indeed there is no 'wow' factor anymore. Maybe we are all a much tougher crowd to please and impress. Maybe they are not trying hard enough. However, in my humble opinion, the lounges work. They work similar to the way that CGK T2 Departures (without any wow factor) work in providing stress free departures experience (okay, Saphire or autogate is a must).

Before the change to SQ SIN-KUL flights, FC used to be one of the easiest FFPs in the world to get top tier status! As for BAEC, it depends on your circumstances, e.g. * 25,000 BA miles for an upgrade from WT+ to CW from LHR to anywhere in North America is a pretty good deal (plus availability tends to be quite good) particularly when you earn most of it back (even more so with the silver/gold 25/50% bonus). * For those based in the UK, BA's tie up with Tesco (and the Amex 241 vouchers) mean that with some planning it's enough to get enough miles for a trip for two each year to somewhere nice, e.g. I've done NRT (J) and NRT (F) in past years and have CPT (F) coming up next month. Some people in the past earnt enough to do that each year without even stepping foot on a plane! * Eurocheating and (before they were abolished) the BAH-DOH tier point runs etc means that it's pretty easy to get top tier status on BAEC. Of course none of this comes close to just how generous BD are with their programme... \"},\n",

While KF Gold is nice in that it gets you Star Gold privileges with Star Alliance carriers, I've always felt that SQ have missed out on a big opportunity to increase loyalty (and revenue) by targeting frequent travellers in Y. I think SQ have done reasonably well to maintain loyalty of F and J pax. It is essential for a premium airline like SQ to pamper guests in F and J, and they need to maintain or even increase the exclusivity and benefits of PPS membership to retain (regain?) the loyalty of this segment. But they have long neglected the frequent travellers in Y sandwiched between the top end and the budget conscious, giving them 2nd class frequent flyer benefits, for example, the mediocre KF Gold lounge in Changi, and the fact that if you travel Y, even if you do 150-200K miles a year (Which I do on a fairly regular basis), you will not hit PPS. For that reason, in recent years, as soon as I hit 50K miles and qualify for KF Gold, I essentially stop flying SQ and move across to Oneworld, who treat their economy class frequent flyers much better. That effectively means my annual spend on SQ is between 25 to 30% per year of what it used to be. I am probably not alone in that segment, and with recent corporate cutbacks, I am sure more business travellers are having to travel Y for shorter journeys, or consider alternative airlines with cheaper J options. If I were SQ management, I would refine their loyalty strategy to reflect this, and be more inclusive when it comes to their Y frequent flyers. It's not going to restore my business to SQ to earlier levels, though. I've grown to like Oneworld carriers like QF, BA, JL and CX so much that even if and when I start flying J regularly, I will probably continue flying Oneworld, and not just SQ. \"},\n",

I signed up to the QF FF programme many years ago, even before Krisflyer was launched. I've not done a detailed comparison of the merits of other OW FF programmes like CX / BA, but I chose the QF programme simply because among the Oneworld carriers, I flew them the most, and over the longest distances. Apart from SQ, they are my airline of choice to ANZ, and to London (If I decide to do a one-stop). Even today, if I choose a one-stop to London, I will try to fly the DXB-LHR sector on QF metal. They have treated me quite well as a frequent flyer (QF Gold / OW Sapphire this year), with the occasional op-up from PEY to J. And even though I fly only Y, I can use their superb lounges in Australia, HKG and elsewhere. The OW lounges that CX, JL and BA have in their respective home bases are very good as well. I've also been upgraded several times on CX and BA. Award and upgrade availability has been ok as well. As an unintended benefit, through the EK tie-up, I get to use the EK lounges too (Although I have never been upgraded on EK). SIN is my home base, and if I had to go with one program, SQ and Krisflyer/Star would be the one. But being a frequent flyer on Qantas/Oneworld has brought me many benefits as well, and I am happy to have had the opportunity to sample what Oneworld has to offer. \"},\n",

Between us we've been to almost all of them. One time I mentioned about tubs in FRA FCT or FCL. One of SKL management staff said why would a pax want to be in the tub? Shower is enough. My answer was when I arrive in FRA from SIN early am, before my flight to the US/Canada, having a bath in a tub is heavenly refreshing. Perhaps the management has made a poll among SQ premium pax, and the majority of SQ flyers do not like to take a bath before flight. \"},\n",

The TG folks will try to steer you towards the SK Lounge; just say no. Turn left when you get to the junction where the path from the T3 shopping area joins the paths to the gates. It will be further down (leftwards) from the SK Lounge. It's one floor above the departure level. If you don't have heavy hand luggage, take the stairs. The elevator is very slow (though charming in its un-modernized way). The hot food tends to be available when the SQ passengers are expected to show up (roughly 3-4 hours before departure). That's OK; the lounge is open outside those hours. The sandwiches and munchies are still better than what can be found in the SK Lounge. For alcoholic drinks, you'll have to order from the staff at the bar. It's no big bother. The staff (reception and bar) are very friendly. Some pics: Pretty good window views (though the views are usually of SK aircraft, not as international a panorama as the views from the VS CH -- but occasionally you'll get a peek of a Golden Goose-decorated tailfin, as in the first picture below ): Munchies bar; wine/G&Ts requestable from the bar located left towards the front of the picture (where you see the bar stools; this area is to the left as you emerge from the stairs): \"},\n",

London Lounge has a Scandinavian atmosphere to it, while I know SKL C will be a home for me being such an SQ sucker. But really it depends on the time of the day I am sure. London Lounge can be too crowded when AC, SK, and TG have more flights departing around the same time. SKL C would be crowded when it's near SQ flights departing. If you have continuing flight from BKK on TG F or C, you can use their TG Spa which has the massage perk. \"},\n",

In the omission of such information on the SQ website, I\\'m assuming the answer will be a big fat \\'no.\\' I did read on the Star Alliance website that First Class passengers are entitled to a guest each at Star Alliance First Class lounges, presumably including the operating carrier\\'s own lounges, but I suspect the TPR isn\\'t really a \"Star Alliance lounge\" for the purpose of *A entry policies? I remember bringing in a guest some years ago based on First Class travel but this was the SKL First (back when redemptions cut no mustard with TPR). My partner and I are both flying MEL-SIN-LHR in Suites in 2 weeks and coincidentally, a dear friend and his gf are flying in the opposite direction LHR-SIN-AKL and the transit times happen to tee up, so I thought it\\'d be a really lovely to treat them to some time in the TPR.

Hi LHR, The SQ lounge is still being constructed. It was all boarded up when I was there on 7 Nov (Fri). I was given the choice of either the United Lounge, Air Canada Lounge or Plaza Premium Lounge. The Air Canada lounge is near the Satellite Terminal B gates. Some pictures of the AC lounge below. There are also showers in the AC lounge if you want to freshen up before the flight. The SQ lounge under construction appears to be located next to the AC lounge. There is also a Lufthansa Lounge (Star Gold lounge) near the A gates in the main terminal which was not mentioned in the one-pager lounge info sheet by SQ. There is a great restaurant in the T2 airside area, The Perfectionists' Cafe, with dishes by Heston Blumenthal. I would highly recommend eating there before your flight if you are leaving in the afternoon or evening. The pics are from an upcoming TR... \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" Okay let me try a sensible contribution As far as the TK IST lounge goes it is definitely still my favourite *G lounge around. Yes, as MAN Flyer mentioned, even after expansion it is still crowded at times, but overall the space and the offerings (food / drinks / amenities) are very good. The catering is Do&Co and pretty tasty. Last time I visited the cakes were actually brought in from Austria from Demel which is one of the top places in Vienna (yes touristy, but still when it comes to pastries. Of course Demel is owned by the same Turkish owner that runs Do&Co. But I digress. The space issue and cleaned out buffets is especially bad around times when loads of flights to the Central Asian Republics depart (9PM onwards) - sorry but that is when I have observed the worst situations. It turns into mayhem and I have never seen a buffet cleaned out in such a short amount of time with people literally carrying plates stacked 10cm high with food. As if they were famished. The Turkish chef making the tasty 'Pide' (kind of a Turkish pizza version) almost lost it when 2 women loaded up food that would have fed 10-12 people normally. Showeres are good, but the few restig rooms on offer are super hard to come by and tied to certain restrictions (IIRC transfer over 4hrs and under 7 or 8hrs). Okay that's it.

We were there around lunch time coming in from FCO (got the fancy TK C seat on this A321) and connecting to the TK SIN flight (A330 fully flat) at midnight. Hence we had no queue around that time and plenty of freshly made tasty treats. Had lunch, then coffee / tea and nice cakes. Then we locked our bags in the lockers (good feature) and headed into town (via subway) for a quick spin around some areas we know in IST and had a nice dinner before heading back. Luckily we just got back to the lounge before the mayhem started and had a good seating area plus were on top of the shower list. We were stuffed already and couldn't eat anymore to preserve some space in our tummies as TK inflight meals in C are really good in my book (best C food all around I have had so far). So the impact on us was not that bad, but the scenes playing out weren't that funny if you tried to grab a bite and a bit of rest before the next flight. \"},\n",

       "  'reply': \" my $0.0001 worth (what with the economy in the crapper and all....) I'm with MANFlyer on this one re: arrivals lounges. I always touchdown into SIN between 6am-7am. Less than 30mins after, I'm sat sipping a mug of coffee in the kitchen of the house just off the upper ECR in Bedok. But, if you really must have a shower at the airport (because of hotel check-in times or not having a crash pad locally), what's to stop you staying airside and using the showers in the lounges in T2 or T3 and clearing immigration after? Arriving into MAN, you can pay a nominal fee to use the showers at the airport Radisson hotel. Ok, It can be argued that if you're in F or J, why should you have to pay a few extra quid. Conversely, if you are in F or J, what's a few extra quid anyway? \"},\n",

Can we use LH FCL at FRA as arrival lounge (assume we arrive on LH F, and FRA is end of trip or stop over...). In this case, what will happen with our checked luggage?

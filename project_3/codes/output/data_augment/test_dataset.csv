" While waiting for my mileage to be posted from credit card to Krisflyer, the availability from CDG-SIN SQ333 (A380) is gone. It started waitlist 2 weeks ago.

" Was standing at the entrance to the SKL waiting for someone the other day - for a good 1/2 hour mind you. Post 12:00am Sept 1, of course. Noticed some common behaviours amongst the pax coming in. I counted at least 40-45 people who genuinely didn't know of the changes ""Since when?"" was a very common reply. We, as members of SQTalk take an interest in these things and have known about the changes for ages, but we're but a handful. There are quite a few people out there who genuinely didn't know. . There were also a few mutterings about how intransparent the PPS value thing was, and how befuddled many of them were. As far as getting the message across, I fear it's turning out to be a bit of a PR disaster for SQ here. In all fairness, I don't think they could have done anymore short of regular 2 minute TV commercial slots at prime time. Not a good situation regardless of whose fault it is though. SKL staff getting so much abuse I wonder if any of them will want to work there anymore. I mean serious verbal abuse for all and sundry pertaining to those changes. I saw another 20-30 QPP's in J who looked like they knew the new rules, but were trying their luck but were not allowed into the SKL F. About half of them trudged over to the J side, the other half swore they were not coming back and never flying SQ again, and walked out. Even if half of them were pure crocodile tears, I think at least some proportion of them said it with enough conviction to actually carry out those threats. There was another gentleman who was very eloquent at putting his message across, and it got me thinking too. He stated the obvious ""this new program is meant to get rid of the 25ers"" - i.e. those that just scraped by,of which there are a great number of. He continued to say something along the lines of :The changes do however make an assumption that the 25ers will still continue to fly the equivalent of 25. They won't. The motivation to be a 25er is not the same anymore, as it will likely mean there's no plastic card waiting for me. Nobody's that stupid. Sure, the flights are full now with 744's having left the fleet, and the 380's being delayed and all so no one in management cares - for now. Those who are happy with the changes could argue that it's these sort of flyers that SQ wants to get rid of, and to concentrate on moving PPS truly upmarket for the benefit of the few who DO pay. This whole thing is so polarizing that I'm wondering if this is going to turn out to be the SQ masterstroke that defines premium loyalty service for all others to follow, or it's biggest PR headache since October 2000. Made for a very interesting 1/2 an hour though. ",1

For October, because of Expedia's super juicy 6x miles/$ promo with Citibank, I purchased another ticket that cost me SGD 3,700 but I am getting a PPS value of only SGD 3,268 which seems to be the fare without the fuel surcharge. I just want to check if anyone has noticed any difference in PPS value between booking directly with SQ and through a travel agent. I have sent an email to SQ, waiting for their feedback / explanation. ",1

" If you are planning to fly with an infant (0-2 years), and do not require a seat for him/her (i.e. lap baby + bassinet), there is no need to redeem KF miles. Make the KF redemption online for the adults (to take advantage of the online discounts), and then call SQ reservations (not KF membership) to add an infant booking to the ticketed itinerary. You would have to pay 10% of the full fare for the segments booked + any applicable airport taxes (reminder: they will need to see the credit card you used to buy the infant ticket when you check in even though the adult tickets are paid with miles). This often comes out to be only slightly more than the ridiculously high fuel surcharges you get charged on a normal redemption booking and you get to save all your miles. SQ reservations will waive the phone ticketing fees in this instance as you are not able to add an infant booking online when redeeming miles. This is a straightforward process which I've done 4 times over the last one year (3x with SQ and 1x with MI). If you do want a seat for the infant however (in which case you need to bring a carseat to secure the infant to the seat), then I guess you have to make a redemption for a child ticket. ",1

" Originally posted by cawhite View Post I'm still waiting for that to happen Hi All, Just want to assure you all that indeed I am trying to run for my LPP. It will be a very long shot, but at least I can say I try. I understand that being LPP might not be a good idea in the future, but definitely in my limited understanding, PPS Value is not a platform of being frequent flyers anymore. As an example, with the increase of fares from CGK to LAX, someone flies two roundtrip would be a QPP. Sounds like an infrequent flyer for me. Of course, I have to make it clear that my runs will be on any cheap fares on SQ. Basically it is minimum costs while maximizing overall redeemable miles! I am trying for the run after getting many encouragements from everyone here. Many reasons, many advantages and disadvantages had been told to me. And yes, the SKL staff at Changi are the supporters of this run for life idea. In addition, I was told that at the moment, there is no LPP in Canada. Thus, it would be very sweet, if I would make it as the the first and the last LPP in this part of the world. In short, I will try to do my run, and hopefully I could make it by August 31. Wish me luck, Note: I have done a bit of short runs. In these few flights, sadly enough, the FAs seemed not too well informed about the changes in PPS. Yes, they know about there is a change, but the crew that I met so far, did not know that the change has been officially announced. ",1

But still not likley I think. The cost for awards between airlines has nothing to do with the pricing presented to customers. As far as I know, airlines pay a fixed sum per mile flown. SQ would get more money from e.g. LH for SIN-AMS then they would get for SIN-FRA. Yet, SQ can charge Krisflyer members anything they want. ",1

When I moved to Singapore, I was thrilled as my job includes some traveling around in Asia. Some thoughts after 12 weeks… First of all, SQ is listening (and lurking). Although a lowly KF member at that time only, a letter of complaint to the CEO was responded by a phone call to my office. SQ took me out for lunch and was keen on learning more about my travel patterns and needs. Thumbs up. Products. The new business class is a great product and I very much like the design and comfort of these seats. Food is still better than on many other airlines – and olive oil is one of the nice touches that survived any cost cutting (only outdone by NH – they also serve salt and sesame so that one can dip the bread with the olive oil). I love the Sky Suites and I am very sorry to see that product being phased out. The difference between First and Business on the 77W is marginal, you will not see me in F on the 77W very often. The Regional F product is a disgrace for SQ – advertising Suites on the one hand and then forcing you on an overnight flight from Dubai into this inferior product is just disgusting. There must be a reason why you won’t find any information about that product on their webpage. Thumbs down. SQ should keep the 747. PPS. Yes, I made it – now I will loose my meal in F only to a fellow pax if he is TPP (unless SQ is changing this non-sense policy of catering only one meal for certain dishes even for fully booked flights). I support SQ in their decision to base qualification on PPS Value. As an airline you don’t care about how often a customer is boarding or how many miles he is flying – bottom line, revenue is the only thing that counts. But comparing PPS to LH’s SEN (*G), I don’t know why SQ hates it elites. Reduced services fees – where? Business Class Check-In and Lounge access when you fly Economy – you gotta be kidding me. Preferred treatment for award tickets or seats – history. Milage earnings on SQ for F is a joke (with and without PPS bonus). Why would that motivate me to spend 25,000 SGD on SQ? Changi Airport is still a mystery to me – SQ is failing to meet my expectations for a smooth travel experience there. Screening at the gate is not a smart thing – where are the priority lines? Even flying in F, there is a huge gap to LH which I am familiar with (their F Terminal in FRA is still setting the benchmark). It seems that my airplane is always parked on the gate that is furthest away from the lounge and flying in F you are not only facing different experiences in terminals 2 and 3 but you are also divided into paying and non-paying pax with different access rights to the Private Room. Worst thing I have ever seen – I don’t feel like apologizing for spending 360.000 KF miles on a redemption ticket in F. Competition. Forced SQ to introduce their 77W to India. Will force them to re-think their premium prices for Suites. Will hopefully make them listen more closely to their elites. And definitely has already lost them a lot of business due to their unthoughtful changes in their offerings and their offensive behaviour towards its elites. Definitely the most powerful force to move SQ. If you are a staff member – keep doing a great job. I appreciate outstanding service experiences and I am making sure that SQ knows about it. ",1

I've thought about it, and I've decided to just buy a Y ticket like you suggested, and then waitlist for the upgrade - at least then my whole family would have guaranteed seats.

I want to know out of these 3 programmes which one shall I put 100K miles of my HSBC reward points in to redeem awards on. It doesn't matter which airlines I fly as I will not put my flown miles in any of these 3 programmes. Only exception is maybe Asia Miles as discounted economy flights on CX still credit 100% with them. My business/first class flights on CX will be credited into AAdvantage. Assuming the HSBC rewards program in your country have the same points to miles exchange rates for all Enrich, Krisflyer and Asia Miles (as an example, this does not hold true in Malaysia, here Enrich costs a little bit more rewards points per mile to exchange than KF/AM) - I'd put it in Enrich assuming they all had the same rate. Simply because long haul burn rates are not too bad, they have 30% off quite frequently and you've got a shot a potentially being able to use them on OW when they join later. KF burn ratios aren't as good long haul, maybe a bit better short haul, but those short haul tickets are the ones you want to buy with cash anyway. AM burn ratios to me are probably the worst of the three. Not going to talk about earn ratios, as you mention you're not putting any flights to them, only your HSBC points. ",1

" Originally posted by inix View Post I think it all boils down to 1 thing. Moolah. Firstly, its more cost effective. You only need 1 set of people managing several gates, hence multi-tasking. Secondly, one can actually have merchants there, thus generating more revenue from the space. I remember that Harris is actually at the gates of T3 aint' it. Cost effective in what respect? If it's wages, I would disagree as one can just move the same set of security personnel to another gate as quickly. It may be simpler (just only a tad) from a logistics standpoint. If it's related to equipment and thus cost, again, no as there are almost the equal number of those xray machines in the 'combined' security area. Revenue from merchant? Maybe. Why was T2 'security at gate' designed the way it was? Why has T3 changed? The concept is still - screening at gate. Can anyone with aiport security/planning experience chime in? Is it a function the different levels of security or is it just simply incoming and outgoing pax intermingle in the 'secure' airside?

My dad had to fly to the US (SFO) very often for business and my family would tag along. My sister and I would present our young explorer cards at the desk and feel all grown up as the check in agent (they actually cared about their jobs back then) importantly handled our cards first and credited miles to our account (they even had their own tier system for young explorer, i think the more miles you flew the better gifts you were eligible for. like a pencil case. or a water bottle. no krug though) I remember in the days before 9/11 they were much laxer with security on the plane. Sometimes the door to the cockpit would even be left open. We would be on the 747 and on the upper deck, and at some point in the flight the stewardess would come up to us and ask us if we wanted to go see the captain. Of course we did, and the captain would entertain us for about 15 minutes or so, pointing at various knobs and buttons before signing our passport book, which was to certify that we had travelled the miles.

" Still Confused about KF Elite Gold Qualification I know this has been discussed over and over again. Sorry for making all you guys yawn. I'm putting up my past and future accrual here - hopefully the table format helps everyone get a timeline picture of my situation. I've been a KF member for many years but have not been accumulating mileage seriously until last year. My KF membership runs from Sep - Aug. I was promoted to KF ES in Dec 2009 and my KF ES membership runs from Dec - Nov. The table is pretty self-explanatory. Counter 1 shows my cumulative mileage for current KF membership year, while Counter 2 shows my cumulative mileage since obtaining KF ES. This leads to the most famous question everyone has been asking - when will I get KF EG? In Aug 2010 when I've achieved 56946 miles for the current KF membership year? Or in Oct 2010 when I've achieved 52601 miles (reset) after starting as KF ES? While most members on this forum have been able to achieve KF EG after achieving 50k during the ordinary membership year, SQ's website seems to suggest that it requires 50k more after qualifying for KF ES. I quote SQ website saying ""KrisFlyer Elite Gold status will be yours when you achieve 50,000 Elite miles in any class of service on Singapore Airlines, SilkAir or any Star Alliance airline during your Elite Silver membership year"" Comments and recent experiences will be appreciated.

Over the past few years, I've dropped from TPPS all the way to KFES last week, mostly due to the change in my job role. The bulk of my travel these days are leisure related. While in the past decade or so, I've felt compelled to chase re-qualification for TPPS or PPS, and before that, KFEG, I've re-discovered. in the past year or so, the freedom to fly whatever airline that gives me the best value or timing. It has been quite a liberating experience, though of course, one has to deal with the withdrawl symptoms of not being able to stand on a carpet when one checks-in, having to keep myself seated when they announce commencement of boarding and the realization that I'm no longer Mr Carbonman the VIP to the cabin crew.

" We've discussed this to varying degrees on here a few times, and the consensus is always more or less the same ; those who have to travel a lot for work have had enough of it (and are even sick to death of it), and those who travel mainly for leisure still enjoy it, sometimes. As I have said before, many moons ago before I travelled so much I used to watch with envy as a family friend jetted off every month to 'exotic locations in S.E. Asia' as I saw it then. When I expressed a desire to do that myself one day, he told me to be careful what I wish for as it is not the fun it's cracked up to be. This was before 9/11 and the security clampdown (the majority of which is valueless bullsh*t) that made travelling sometimes a miserable experience. Until last night this was my itinerary for my next trip, starting today: SA 22 OCT MAN-LHR SA 22 OCT LHR-BKK MO 24 OCT BKK-KUL MO 24 OCT KUL-BKK MO 24 OCT BKK-PER TU 25 OCT PER-BKK WE 26 OCT BKK-HKG WE 26 OCT HKG-ICN TH 27 OCT ICN-BUS TH 27 OCT BUS-GMP (don't get me started on ICN-BUS again...) FR 28 OCT ICN-SIN SU 30 OCT SIN-BKK SU 30 OCT BKK-SIN SU 30 OCT SIN-LHR MO 31 OCT LHR-MAN Absolutely ridiculous. Granted the hop up and back to BKK next Sunday is to start a particular ticket, which is my call, but the rest of it is stupid. Fortunately I can probably afford to give Perth a miss next week (handy as Queenie is there for first time in years and there is a Commonwealth Heads of State Meeting ), so I am doing. I am also not prepared to risk so many transits through BKK next week as I don't trust the Thai authorities with the flooding. I wouldn't mind if it was a holiday, but not for such a tight work trip. I may well be there at some point later in the week but I'll see how it goes. As a result instead of flying TG F from LHR-BKK today I am still at home, relaxing with a smile on my face as I don't need to travel until tomorrow. I know there will be some who would rather be flying TG F than sat at home, but I am certainly not one of them. And that tells me all I need to know about how I view travelling these days. ",1

" Originally posted by alian View Post Yes they don't get stored. But in this case for SQ747 as per mine previously it is new qualification and not renewal so upon getting newly qualified KF gold all trips after this qualification should be entered for the next cycle of requalification. Well there is also timing and planning considerations and how exchange scenario folds so it's really a case by case situation and that's why we should always plan out our memberships strategically to suit our purpose and way of travel. I think the way the status counter works (At least for KF Silver/Gold) is that the miles are calculated within the single accrual year. As far as I know, there is no concept of keeping the miles for the next accrual year's status calculation, whether for new status or renewal. If there is, it would be great, but I have not seen it happen in my account. The only ""bonus"" I have seen is that if you become a new Gold halfway through one year, then your Gold is valid for the next year as well, so you get the remaining half of the existing year as Gold, plus the next full year as Gold. But to keep Gold, you need to accumulate 50K in the next year. Anything you do in the remaining half year doesn't count as far as status is concerned. The only way to tweak your qualification is to decide when you fly, and ensure that the date you flew is in the accrual year that you want. All this is from an end-user perspective of course...maybe someone should post this question on SQ's own FB page, or call KF membership services to get an authoritative answer. At least for Silver/Gold they should be able to give you a straight answer. For PPS Value, they may be a little more evasive... ",1
 Thanks. The waitlist was on a separate booking. I called and I had to cancel the booking for the return flight for US$30 or 35 and got the miles back then rebook the return flight as a one way saver.

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post That's an awful lot of reserve value. If the crew do treat LPP better than TPP then they shouldn't because I can assure you that the SQ 'rating' for upgrades etc (on the rare occasions hell has actually frozen over) puts current TPP and LPP on exactly the same level. As far as SQ are concerned current TPP is just as valuable as LPP. This does actually make sense because as you say there are LPP's that will hardly be flying nowadays yet others are still spending a lot of money with them, so the TPP is more valuable to SQ now then the LPP. This does all bring it back to the issue with dropping LPP though as it has now encouraged people to start flying with others when they have re-qualified, which is the opposite of what they want. But with the issue as outlined above is explains an argument for dropping it s well. That's what I thought too, but i honestly got a shock when I heard the crew fawn over Mr LPP and kept repeating oh the ""Life"" wants this the ""Life"" wants that, and I could barely get their attention. I understand it was almost full in F class, but I paid for a seat too.... I guess some of the crew still believe LPP is above TPP and it doesn't cascade through the whole system...

" It is not that difficult for an individual PAX to earn over 150,0000 miles per annum. There has been a lot of discussion on SQTALK about SIA not allowing redemptions on certain routes to other Star Alliance Members. I have not seen the figures but I would guess that the number of Star Alliance miles are on the increase every year with more airlines joining *A and increasing members joining each airlines FFP. SIA obviously differentiate its redemption avaialbiity by prodcut with J saver redemptions not available on routes flown by certain types of aircraft. I would suggest overtime it will become more difficut to redeem J saver awards unless SIA changes its policy on redemption on certain types of equipment which only standard redemptions are available. Many airlines themsleves value each point at less than one tenth of a cent in their own financial statements. I undertand that other FFP are more generious in partnership programs and earning points which have in effect devaluated their FFP due to lack of redemptions. Other airlines such as QANTAS and EMIRATES allow redemptions on a range of products. I believe that over time that the *A FFP will become less valuable for the individual PAX as the number of star alliance points in cyber space will continue to increase and the product availabiliy remains limited. Even today a lot of my business associates have difficulty redeeming KF miles out of Sydney and Melbourne. Movever, there have been many posts on SQTALK complaining about the lack of J Saver awards the inability to redeem accrued milage. I am lucky that SIA is still flying A330s out of Brisbane and can reedem. ",1

I'm looking at upgrading a booking from Economy to Business using points when I travel in May.

How far in advance should the upgrades be requested? and do you find out straight away when you get them, or do they need to go for some sort of approval process.

" Originally posted by Spaniard View Post I'd like to see this devaluation with a bit more context to understand the overall value of KF as a loyalty program. Granted being able to redeem miles for award flights is one of the key value elements and this needs to factor in both amount of miles required plus availability. In the absence of availability figures to compare with other airlines it is difficult to say whether SQ has better or worse availability than others. What definitely I find hugely annoying is the waitlisting policy and having to chase them for this. It is not very customer centric to say the least. ... Not pretending to troll SQ or anything like that, it is still a company I admire in many aspects, but rather share my feeling regarding this latest twist - I expected to be really upset by it but I just found myself pretty indifferent, and that I guess is a bit sad when it comes to customer loyalty. It would be good to do a bit of homework to put things in perspective first. 1) There is no other FFP that is so generous in handing out awards in Business and First as SQ. In 8 years of flying SQ I have never not gotten a flight reward. 2) Waitlisting is a fair process whereby SQ is still handing out award seats but can also prioritise the order in which they are given out to loyal members first. 3) SQ is still reserving awards in Business and First Class to its own members only, so the 'competition' for award seats is limited to Krisflyer members and not the whole of StarAlliance. I wish SQ would do more to look after their PPS members and I think the program itself is absolutely mediocre. Notwithstanding that, there is no other airline that allows so much premium travel on miles - I am very grateful for the number of times I sat in Suites and First and just paid with my miles. ",1

I thought I would weigh in on the discussion with a few other comments. Most FFPs work with grace periods (as does LH M&M), and these are key to the whole scheme, depending on how you go about requalifying. Certainly, if you book an FRTWSTAR2, the Exec Bonus does not matter. However, if you book a CRTWSTAR3, you definitely need the extra status miles the bonus provides in order to make it (yes, Exec Bonus miles count for status). Of course, BA is the exception to the rule, but they've always been rather harsh on their members. One other thing - if maintaining *G is your main objective, you can also maintain UA *G by requalifying once every three years. If you qualify for UA 1K, you get the year during which you qualify, the year after that, plus a year of 1P status (because UA has a soft landing for elites; LH does as well, by the way). If you then requalify for 1K in the two month grace period, you'll have uninterrupted UA*G status. However, this method is far difficult, because of the lower CoS bonii UA offers. Unless you're flying Y, earning 1K requires a lot more flying than earning SEN. ",1

 Just rang up to get my travel $ balance and got told its negative. They agreed this is not possible and said there is a glitch in the system and will have to revert to me. My take on what happened is last month they accidentally credited every single account with way too many miles - I had 50k more than I thought I should and I know of others with 50-200k more. Now they're trying to fix it and have probably gone too far the other way. I recommend cardholders check their statements and balances for their rewards points. ,1

" In my limited experience in dealing with KF agents, IMHO, I don't think the agent is lying or making up rules as the title otf this thread stated. I should say the agent is unknowledgeable. Or it's following the training course that was given. If you think the agent was lying in your case, I don't know what to say if you happen to pool your miles on BD Diamond Club and try to book a redemption ticket. The agents on line for BD redemptions are mostly following certain procedures. So, if I gave my postal code and the street address afterwards, they got confused, i.e. asking me to repeat the answer according what the manual says in front of his/her computer. And yes, many times they would say it's not possible like when I wanted to take a flight for YVR to ZRH. They were always sticked to AC or whatever came up in the computer. When I said tried YVR-SFO-JFK on UA and JFK-FRA SQ FRA-ZRH on LX. They would answer it's not possible. The rules do not allow that. But with patient and ""a call back later"" strategy, I found that I could get better results to my best advantage. Anyhow, you were lucky to be able to see row 31 or 32 in your seat booking on line. Guess what? For me, even though, I bought my Y tix SIN-ZRH for tomorrow in Y on line, I could not see any seats available for row 31 on line at all. And yes, my KF number is there. So I had to get help from SQ office to grab seat 31H. And just now, I checked my on line booking, and looked up seat map, it still did not show any seats on row 31 on line. ",1

Or does it have to do with one sector being waitlist? Anyway, i figured I may as well also extend the expiry of my miles instead of burning it. Replies much appreciated! Yes, the miles are not deducted because your itinerary is not confirmed and because you still have one sector in the waitlist, you cannot confirm the itinerary.

" Your chances are pretty low I would say. Firstly its the peak season, and I know from experience last year that they already started charging full fare Y tickets 3 months out from December as all the other lower booking fare classes were already zeroed out. Since it already cost so much for a revenue ticket which indicates that the flight load is full or almost full, it is very unlikely for SQ to open up additional award inventory. This is in reference to the JFK-SIN direction as a lot of people are heading home during that period. Loads from SIN-JFK are lower from what I know.

" Originally posted by jagmeets View Post My understanding is that SQ is likely to open up more award seats closer to the travel date for the return leg. Herein lies the quandry - my ticketing deadline is 25th April - what happens if another award seat doesn't open up by then? A very common problem - for which the only option for you to take is a cancellation or ask them to hold off for 2-3 more days. Originally posted by jagmeets View Post As per the Krisflyer call center, I could book my return leg for a date when there is a seat available and waitlist for my preferred date. However they pointed out that this entails a loss of the 15% online redemption discount (anyway of doing this online?). There's no way of doing this online, however you could ask them nicely to waive it - some agents might bend the rules a bit because they understand the system isn't foolproof and can't take into account every single possibility. They escalate the issue up to a supervisor who is granted fairly wide latitude and discretion. The supervisor then authorises the agent with a 15PC code. They DO tend to err on the sympathetic side, in my experience. Originally posted by jagmeets View Post Any wagers on the likelihood of another O seat opening up before my ticketing deadline? If revenue seats are available, there tends to be some at the T-3 day mark (from my experience), however, that might be too little too late for you.

Not that I did anything else to complain about her to KF or SQ. I accepted it. Perhaps just an expectation that was not met. Kind of like when you expect to be given a towel onboard of certain temperature and it was not. yauee: I have experienced the same (with pop up during selection for row 31 seats). But had no problem selecting any seats from row 32. Well as you said, I am not a typical pax. And yes, I am happy with who I am. I am happy with my life which takes downturn at the moment. And I choose not to expect much. Regarding hot towels, come on, when you fly for 6 years, and the towels were consistently hot, wouldn't you notice when it's not? Thus, my thread about not-so-hot-towel is something that I notice during my travel. And yes, I still accept what they are giving me, whether the towel is back to hot or just luke warm. But I don't feel as being mistreated. Thus your argument for being same as my hot towel case, is irrelevant. Well, if you read my post, when the agent did not see my seats, I made my own assumption that the agent has no access, thus I opt to ask for supervisor or to make a call back.

" Originally posted by DeltaFlyingProf View Post I believe this is incorrect. As far as I understand it, 1 Airpoint$ = 1NZ$ you can spend on NZ, not the opposite. You earn airpoints on a scale that depends on what flight and class you do fly and not related to the actual spending at all. Thus if there was an error fare for $2 between AKL and LHR in business class, you would simply earn 370 airpoints dollars which is the same as if you paid $5,000 for it. http://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/airpo...rn_accrual.htm Yes, sorry, that is correct. The point i didn't make very well was NZ in a bold move simply dumped their miles metric altogether and replaced it with an 'Airpoint Dollar'. The dollars earned are indeed set by the airline, based on their own internal working that reflects the value of any sector. Once credited to a member account, the Airpoint Dollars are as good as cash to 'buy' any flight for which you have enough Airpoint Dollars. Since Airpoint Dollars are tabled this scheme unlike SQ's is fully transparent. If you check the table carefully you will see there is a causal link between revenue and Airpoint dollars awarded. I also understand that Virgin Blue have a more SQ like program where awarded credits are directly linked to actual purchase price in their Velocity programme. ",1

" There are plenty of KF G members here. but your query relates to qualifying for KF G from a standing start (i.e. 0 miles). I believe most members here qualified for KF G from an existing KF S status. Ever since SQ introduced rolling qualification periods for KF tier upgrades sometime mid 2007 (IIRC), the exact qualifying criteria has been unclear. As Nick C stated, he has had this experience before and he got through it alright. I certainly hope it to be the case for you. But as your excerpt states, the issue that is giving me (and I believe many others) reason to be uncertain is this clause ""you achieve 50,000 Elite miles in any class of service on Singapore Airlines, SilkAir or any Star Alliance airline during your Elite Silver membership year"" it seems to suggest that only Elite miles earned during an Elite Silver membership year will count towards the 50,000 quota for KF G. This means that you already have to be a KF S for any miles earned to count towards 50,000. The way i read it, it's directly contradicting the first paragraph of the excerpt. It's very poor drafting but hey I didn't draft it. haha. I think its important that this be cleared up. In view of the economy over the next year or so, some of us may let our KF statuses lapse and then go on one Banzai year to reattain our KF status.

I'm sure that VS and SQ only did this because eligible pax would ever use the SKL in preference to the VSCH. But in doing so they have reduced the F experience further and at a time when premium cabins are hard to fill, maybe this wasn't the smartest move as there are heaps of other options on sectors that gateway through Asia.

" Originally posted by Nick C View Post matt_will_fix_it, This has been brought up many times. One will only need 50000 miles in a 12 month period regardless whether he/she is a new member or existing member. You have had poor experience dealing with krisflyer over that issue but it has passed so lets move on. There's no such thing has 75000 miles to achieve Gold in a 12 month period. Nick C - We will have to agree to disagree on this one In the case where your Krisflyer account is not in the 12 month period since you enroled in Krisflyer (eg after 1st KF membership year): I agree that you can call Krisflyer once you have credited 50,000 miles to your account within in your membership year and have them upgrade you to gold. However this is not automatic, therefore the majority if KF members who don't know about SQTalk, flyertalk etc will be flying 75,000 miles to reach gold. It is documented in the Krisflyer Programme Guide (page 20) & Krisflyer Web Site to become Elite Gold you need 50,000 miles *after* reaching Elite Silver (which requires 25,000 miles in itself), giving 75,000 miles required to reach gold Its a different story if you're account is in the first 12 months since enrolment - then its 50,000 required to reach gold (system updates automatically). So lets agree to disagree - I agree that you can ask KF to upgrade you after flying 50,000 miles, however its not automatic and its not the official KF programme rules. ",1

" aerosmith: Very helpful (our posts must have crossed as I might have left the browser open in this thread for awhile whilst typing out this reply) - excellent fallback option. nickbot: Actually I re-read that again and gleaned a bit more information from it. I may well sign up for Diner's as a result... SQ LPP: It's a pity TG has no showers on their aeroplane (I may not need a 12-hour shower but at some point, I will need one to show consideration for the sake of my fellow passengers who I'm sure will not want the stench of someone smelling of a Turkish kebab + Dubaian camels). I hope there is somewhere / some locker to store my luggage, as I really do not want to be dragging along two cabin-sized bags and a chocolate cake for the lady halfway across the desert. Also thanks for pointing out the 10:40 departure (I didn't book that one because I wanted some time in Dubai, since I'm there already, and there just happened to be availability - of course, I checked first). Money-wise, having expenses is definitely important. However in a city of oil-millionaires/billionaires, my own funds could well be extinguished faster than I could imagine! I may need the hidden Swiss bank account numbers + access codes of that evil CGK or risk returning back to Singapore on one of my ships... SQFAN: Whilst I'm not certain how being an Australian (or any other nationality) would affect the Dubai-an experience, indeed, I do live by the principle of ""If you don't know, ask"". That's why I'm asking the gurus on SQTalk (and in the two months since I've joined officially, I have learnt a lot more than in the 2-years odd that I've lurked here, not to mention I've met some really wonderful and friendly people in real life). People say that guys hate asking for advice - something to do with their egos, but I'll be the first to say I'd rather be safe than sorry in a foreign land. Also, I am happily secure in my sexuality that I have no problems asking... hehe Seriously, I'd say this forum has some of the friendliest people I've ever met in an online community. I also actually help to admin one myself, and the community here sure is a whole-lot gentler, for which I am ever grateful! Click here to see what I mean (the 10th result on Google search). The forums on that site had a link/thread two years ago that caused me to stumble upon SQTalk in the first place... jhm: I will definitely ask - it may increase my chances of losing my luggage exponentially, though... I may just do some research on DXB / call up the airport to see if they have lockers large enough to store luggage suitable for my purposes whilst I run around. As for the Burj - well, I'm only there for a very short while, and to be honest, I was not thinking that Dubai would be one of my stopovers, more like I had no other alternatives in order to return to Asia... am sure you know what I mean ... since I am there anyway, $75 or even $100usd for an experience of a life-time seems a 'must-do' thing for me. I've probably spent more on even less trivial things. And I am sure it will add +100 reads on my TR after this crazy VIE DO is over! The High Tea at the Peninsula Hong Kong comes to mind... and their teensy cucumber sandwiches, heheh All the above was said in a good-hearted spirit, and I certainly do hope nobody takes it the wrong way also. I'm really a LOT better off in terms of knowing DXB than I was 24 hours ago, so I am happy to have asked. ",0

All I can say to that, they (whoever is pulling out his/her PPS card) has a serious problem. PPS or not the crews are doing a great job and should be treated with respect just as we want to be treated with respect in whatever job we do. I have a friend who is cabin crew, and he always tells me the sort of *joker* who thinks that being a PPS is being like God - and this is before the new rules apply. Story 1: On one of his last flights, he was preparing the aircraft for landing so he went around the cabin (In business class I think) to collect the headsets... Everyone complied - until there was one guy who still had his headset on and when my friend approached him... this guy just stuck out his hand as if to say 'STOP' and with his other hand pulled out his PPS card which was so conveniently already in his front shirt pocket! Er.. what's that supposed to mean? Usually such situations are so strange, it defies words! Story 2: Flight in Mumbai. Passengers are boarding. A particular indian national (sorry if I cause offend - but this case it is relevant).. stood in the aisle in the economy cabin (he was travelling economy) while the other passengers were still boarding the aircraft... held up his coat and with his other hand, snapped his fingers as though he is calling a waiter ! When cabin crew asked him to wait a minute as the aisle is chock full of passengers, he pulled out his PPS card and glared at the Singapore Girl. Who then told him to please wait as the aisle is full. Passenger shouted back... "" I am PPS. How dare you tell me to wait? I will complain!"" My friend actually told me that the nicest passengers are the ones who have been PPS for the longest time, and the ones who have seem to have old money. They are the ones that don't flash it around, and who usually just sit quietly and not demand anything.

" Originally posted by jhm View Post Leaving aside the fact that someone may have joined KrisFlyer fully intending to abide by all the T&C but their circumstances later change (e.g. I lose my job and need the cash) Good idea; arguing using exceptional cases would again not generate a compelling example for me. Originally posted by jhm View Post I still struggle to see why it could be called ""dishonest"" or ""unethical"". To take three situations: * If I use the miles for myself, I pay the airline and the airline transports me. * If I use the miles for my son, I pay the airline and the airline transports my son. * If I use the miles for X (after X pays me), I pay the airline and the airline transports X. Why is the third situation somehow ""unethical"" or ""dishonest"" or not the ""right thing"" ? How does the airline lose out in the third situation compared to the (e.g.) the second ? Yes, it's against the T&C and the airline loses out if X does not otherwise buy a ticket but I think most people (myself included) would not lose much sleep about this. I think the reason you don't see dishonesty is you keep focusing on the actions (as a lawyer should well do ). My definition of ""dishonest"" action is ""representing the opposite of what you would actually do"". Now replace the third condition with ""If I said (i.e., signed a contract that said) I would not sell my miles and then I sell them to X"" ... I hope you see why I do think dishonesty applies to the third example. Nice try, though, with the 'use the miles for X (after X pays me)' phrasing. I have no idea how much the forbidden trade in miles costs SQ. But actual damages in this case isn't really the reason for my stance. It's the act of agreeing to a framework, and then violating it because there's some profit in my violating it. I think it may be difficult for us to arrive at a common ground here because it seems your assessments keep coming back to economic damages (i.e., something worth recovering in court?). Originally posted by jhm View Post Two further examples: * I want a oneway but a return is cheaper. I buy a return knowing full well that I won't use the return. * I die. According to the FFP T&C, my miles become void (certainly so with BAEC - I don't know the position with KF). However, rather than tell the airline my children login to my account and redeem the miles for themselves. In both cases, the T&C are breached. Deliberately. However, I think the vast majority of people would have no problem with either situation and certainly wouldn't call it unethical behaviour. Were your children aware of the T&C? If yes, then yes, they were being dishonest. Is it dishonest or unethical behavior on the scale, and moral unambiguity, of Enron? Of course not. I think it's mostly in the little acts that probably don't add up to big consequences where there would be ethical disagreements that don't have to be resolved by the courts. About your last point, the fact that the vast majority of people may consider one thing acceptable doesn't really strike me as a good test of whether something is right. But that line of thought would get us really OT. Going back to the OP: I myself wouldn't feel right / would feel I am doing something wrong if I sold my miles, given that the T&C are explicit about this. ",1

There's enough misinformation out there. Let's not contribute to it. There are thousands of people who entered Singapore without quarantine - mostly CEOs - approved by the very same government OYK belongs to.

Immediately after serving it to me, she'd noticed that the champagne was no longer bubbly and actually removed it and came back with a new glass from a freshly opened bottle.

" Originally posted by 9V-JKL View Post Actually as Citigold customer, the premiermiles card is child's play. They offer the Ultima card which gives you; amongst other stuff; 135K KF miles when you 1st join and 1-for-1 SQ C tix. But then again its a $2K annual fee 135K KF, well you can do a fair bit with that if you play your cards right. Always nice. Being a once-off (if I read correctly), that'll average out eventually. 1-for-1 SQ C, is that only for booking through a certain travel agent (with of course, inflated mark-up prices)? Originally posted by 9V-JKL View Post But then again its a $2K annual fee Not entirely unexpected, I must say. But then again, it depends how you use it. I wonder with my CC spend, if the Ultima would still come close in terms of earning ratio? Does it match / better the PremierMiles card? Not to mention you'd have to give at least 100k AUM to Citi for the 'privellege'. yongchau: Sure you're not double-posting there, mate? Also as pointed out by milehighj in your other Maybank thread, those special earning rates are at select locations only. Of which I may only patronise 1-2% of the time (of course, you may just happen to go to all those places 90% of the time, so it might be fantastic for you). However, based on what/where I spend, Maybank is nowhere near the kind of mileage accumulation I'm looking at earning under PremierMiles, despite the exorbitant S$25 I'd have to cough up everytime I transfer. So, bottom line is I'm not that impressed with the Maybank side. ",1

" A year and a bit later... As it's been over a year since I qualified for TPP and started this thread, I thought it might be a good time for a brief retrospective. Here are my observations, in no particular order: Spouse card: obviously nice to have, and as I speculated earlier, it does remove the stress of maintaining status. Also useful for the extra luggage allowance. One interesting quirk, which I had not realized before, is that it is definitely not equivalent to full TPP status. Mrs. WBT maintains a separate status in her KF account (silver currently) but she does receive TPP benefits while traveling, and has a different designation on her boarding passes. Lounge access: generally nicer to be in the F lounge at SIN, but mostly for the wines, spirits and citrus-infused water (and less crowding). I think I actually may prefer the food in the business lounge as the F lounge is one level above my tolerance level for fanciness. I like the on-demand prata though. And roast goose in HKG! And the VS Clubhouse at JFK. Otherwise it's been the same lounges as before. Redemption priority: over the last year I've been cashing in a lot of miles for redemptions, and have managed to get close-to-ideal/desired flights. We now typically need three redemption tickets (plus one infant) so it has become harder. I did manage to get 3 Suites saver tickets to ZRH last summer, flying back from AMS in J. Also get PER return and MUC return in J, at saver rates (both times three). My strategy is to waitlist on multiple flights/dates/destinations and see what happens. So far, so good, but requires some flexibility in timing and potentially some positioning flights. Revenue waitlist priority: all waitlists I have been put on for revenue tickets in J have cleared, even ones that looked hopeless. Call center: in chasing waitlists for redemptions I have used the PPS Connect callback a lot, and in almost every instance the agents were good to excellent, mostly from the local call center. On-board recognition: not much noticeable difference. It all depends on the crew, and the IFS. That has more bearing on the service level than TPP. Priority luggage: usually OK at Changi, hit and miss elsewhere. Checking bags through from a JetBlue connecting flight to SQ 25 usually gets them re-tagged with shiny Solitaire tags at JFK, but not always. First class check-in at Changi T3: made a much bigger impact than expected! A surprisingly useful benefit that I didn't really expect to make much of a difference. I'm still glad I made it under the old system, and my reserve value after one year is already enough to keep me at TPP for a few years. Right now it's pretty easy for me maintain TPP but I would be flying SQ for the most part anyway. So far, so good! ",1

" Originally posted by sqlove View Post hi guys, i'm really kinda lost and frustrated about this whole qualifying period requirement and all so if someone could please help me verify what sq/kf is trying to say here, i'd be more than grateful. thanks. i wrote them last month arguing about the inherently unfair system about having to clock 25k miles for ES and thereafter another 50k to qualify for EG, which was when i received a reply stating that exceptions are available for first time EG qualifiers, of which I am one. Hence, the email went on to say I am still well on track for EG with 25k miles, and not 50k as states on the website. sweet news right? uhm, yes and no because in my case i wrote to say that i knew i'd be having some sfo-sin-sfo flights this year, hence i would be able to hit 50k between jan-sept/oct this year, but unfortunately there is this thing about the flights not being within the qualifying year. i went on to say also that if i had known about this qualifying period thing, i would've thrown my old KF account with that 5k+ miles in it and reregistered for a new one. the reply i received yesterday states that I have only accrued 44044 elite miles and hence would require another 5956 elite miles by 30 April 2009 to qualify for EG. here's a short log of my Star Alliance flights this year.

When you registered for your KF program last year, your qualification period was between May 1 2007 till April 30 2008 (my interpretation). Thus by April 30 2008, your account elite miles was reset to ZERO. Remember that KF program is not based on calendar year, i.e. January 1 to December 31, like UA, DL, LH, NW or others. Therefore by April 30, 2008, your UA flights on 1/30/2008 will not be part of your new qualification period. As you can see and count yourself, by August 16 2008 you surpassed 25K mark, which KF acknowledged that by updating your status as ES on August 18, 2008. In September and October 2008, you accumulated 18,078 elite miles, which brings up your total qualification elite miles to 44,044. Thus, to reach 50K mark as EG, you have to earn another 5,956 elite miles (by April 30, 2009 per your qualification period.) Therefore, there is no discrepancy in the answer you get from KF center. Originally posted by sqlove View Post it may also be helpful to note that i was only awarded ES on 18 August 2008, so I'm suspecting that the Jan flights i had on UA were not counted towards this qualifying period (guess my previous qp is April-April). Or can someone please help me understand better if i've got it all screwd up? The answer is above. Your January 2008 flights on UA were counted as for the previous year qualification period. Your account got set to zero elite miles as of May 1, 2008, which is why you was awarded ES on 8/18/2008 after you passed the 25K mark on 8/16/2008. Originally posted by sqlove View Post Is there a way now I can get them to include my Jan flights to count towards my Elite miles? From the explanation above, it is unlikely that your January flights would be counted for elite miles since your account has been rest by April 30,2008. (May I know when was your flights on 2007?)

So far I have found in general above average service in the cabin but the out of cabin experiences aren't too much to crow about and is the source of my grouses about SQ. Compared to other airlines, my personal thoughts are that SQ is still superior but the margin is now thinner (CX and Jet Airways are the other good airlines I have been on). Whilst the attempted investment in CEA seems a good strategic move for SQ, SQ have not done well on airline investments. Partly it is due to airlines being considered as national assets. However, SQ should not forget their loyal customer base that has contributed strongly to its balance sheets that allowed her to make strategic investments. Raising PPS or Solitaire membership hurdle combined with reduced PPS benefits are not something that I as a loyal customer looked forward to. ",1

" SIA &quot;Priority Boarding&quot; - Krisflyer Elite Gold &amp; Star Alliance Gold Thanks! Yes, am aware that most of the other award programs offered by Star Alliance Carriers are better than the Krisflyer program. It seems to be going downhill instead of progressing with the times. Do not get me wrong, I do find the services provided by SQ splendid. It is just the r eward programs that I have issues about. Specifically, on 24 May 2012, I was a passenger on SQ 833 from Shanghai to Singapore. ""Priority Boarding"" was unavailable, and Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold passengers were requested by ground staff to queue and board in sequence at the normal lane. My peers from various Global MNCs, who like myself, are frequent travellers, and are Krisflyer Elite Gold members, affirmed that ""Priority Boarding"" was unavailable on numerous SIA flights and this observation is not isolated to Shanghai Pudong Airport. Since SIA clarified that our ""Priority Boarding"" privileges are still intact, the relevant question therefore, is whether SIA's third-party Ground Handling agents have been adequately briefed on our privileges, that remain status-quo. Perhaps SIA should clarify what operational process efficiencies could be realized, since regardless of boarding priority privileges, there would always be at least two dedicated lanes available for boarding. Would boarding times be reduced and flights depart on-time if Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold passengers were to board the aircraft through these normal designated lanes? The ongoing ""trial"" at selected airports would definitely have interesting statistics (Refer to SIA Response dated 9 May: http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_808702.html). What about the ""opportunity costs""? Surely, Management must have factored in the potential lost patronage from its Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold passengers. A handful would be peeved by this perceived loss in ""Priority Boarding"" privilege, as they would have been turned away by ground staff at the airports. Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold members can only pray that other benefits, associated with our tier level would not suddenly cease, after other ""trials"" at selected airports have been conducted. SIA's business model is in the ""Premium"" category, a brand well-reputed globally. It is known for its excellence in product and service offerings and innovations. Since its post Malaysia-Singapore Airways (""MSA"") era, SIA has prided itself as ""a great way to fly"". With ongoing ""trials"" at airports, and our ""Priority Boarding"" privilege now in a grey zone, is the carrier dangerously and sub-consciously re-positioning itself, from ""Premium"" to ""Budget""? Whilst, in terms of product differentiation, SIA does not charge a fee for ""Priority Boarding"", the only carriers that I know, toying with and unbundling ""Priority Boarding"" are the ""Budget"" and ""No Frills"" carriers. Passengers flying ""Budget"" and ""No Frills"" pay according to how they would like to travel, and ""Priority Boarding"", are priced at a fee. Travellers do understand, and can accept this practice for ""Budget"" and ""No Frills"", but when already paying for premium priced tickets, SIA should steer clear and avoid antagonising its loyal and frequent travellers - its Elite tier included. After all, it takes numerous flight sectors to accumulate 50,000 miles for the annual re-qualification of its Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold membership tier. ",1

Check-in agents would see your booking isn’t ticketed – and, so long as there is availability in the cabin you waitlisted for – the airport had authority to liaise with Krisflyer directly, and have your waitlist request approved on the spot. Fundamentally – you could waitlist at the Saver level, turn up to the airport, and so long as there was at least 1 available seat, you would get on the flight. ",1

Each adult could bring a pushchair for each kid, right? Make the agent duplicate the work again. (Is that possible?)

Clearly, like other carriers, they must be intentionally displaying some extra choices, but is there any basis for what seats the release? I know airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia make the more 'preferred' seats available for elites (i.e. the front few rows, exit rows etc.). Any idea if SQ has any method for their release of seats (obviously not preferred seats) or is it relatively random? Has anyone noticed differences in availability between KFEG, QPPS, TPPS and LPPS, or do they all seem to have an equal benefit over sub-KFEG? Yes, you see more seats and it's easier to get Savers.

" I am sorry to hear about the new VP, SQ LPP. If it's any comfort, I must be such a lowly QPP that I don't even find out that there is a new VP.

A couple of things to consider: You receive a welcome gift for re-qualifying, I think it is around S$ 280.00 to use for on board duty free sales? I used some of mine on my last trip for a pair of nice headsets, really appreciated that. DFP, if that means anything to you, you can deduct the S$ 280.00 from the $ 1,500.00 - only $ 1,220.00 to go. Another factor would be how much will you be flying in the next year on SQ and is it going to make a big difference on the ground and in the air wether you are QPP or not? I know for me on the ground it won't make any difference, as Lynn is still Lynn, she is just as wonderful as she has always been, even before when I was Star Gold with AC with no PPS status, years back. In the air I might not get asked earlier with regards to food selection but usually I am quite easy to please.

" While some people do have legitimate grievances against what they perceived as lesser or unfair treatment, on an overall basis, SQ is still a great way to fly when in comparison with other airlines.

It's so easy to manage and change/reschedule my booking. I don't think SQ is perfect though, I still have some nitpicks, eg few tangible benefits for PPS, the go-by-the-book treatment of all customers, annoying cost-cutting tactics to save a few cents, lack of pro-activeness in handling of customer complaints etc but overall, yes, SQ for me is still a great way to fly.

" JFK Once we landed at JFK, once at the gate, I rushed getting DFP's rollaboard from seat 4F. Hope he remembered giving me the reward, i.e. keeping his promise of certain thing if i help him passing his bag to 4C. And yes, while waiting to get out from the aircraft, I am amused by the fact that few F pax just did not have courtesy manners. They just barged in wanting to go out the door while I was waiting my turn to get out by the galley. At the end I was the last F pax getting off the plane. The immigration hall was empty. But again, a strange method of directing people. There were three desks opened, but we were asked to line up only in two booths. When my turn, the officer was asked by his supervisor to stop and to work somewhere else after finishing my entry process. Interesting guy. He has DL Platinum he said. I travelled heavy. Thus needed a card. Remember it's not free. It's $3. After customs, yeah thanks to the travelling companion, I did not get searched, we headed for the baggage transfer desk. But before that, DFP needed to change the flights on DL back to DEN. Long telephone wait. And of course cawhite had to do her business calls as well. You can see how many carry-on we had on SQ. ",1
" Originally posted by SQ228 View Post Yeah, that's why I was surprised to see them go with 42 J seats in the A359 which is is 16 more than in the 772ERs they are meant to be replacing. On top of that then a PEY section, means a significant decrease in Y seats when an A359 takes over from a 772, but conversely a significant increase in the premium seats they need to fill. I'd have thought that places even more pressure on them in terms of route economics, but I'm no expert in such things. I think there will be more than three configurations for the A350s. Other than the current long-haul, the A359ULR, and the regional configuration, there would probably be one more for long-haul routes that don't have a high premium demand. ",1

" Hello everybody! As a Dutch based traveller i usually find the information about SQ-activities in the Netherlands quite non-excistent on the internet so i decided to start doing some posts here about SQ in the Netherlands and about my upcoming SQ travel. I will travel the 17th december 2008 on SQ 323 in business class (J) so i will have access to the SKL Amsterdam. I've been there before twice: 1) when i was about 10 yrs old, my mom knew the checkin supervisor when SQ still had their own ground staff in Amsterdam. She managed to received an invitation for her family into the SKL even though flying in Y without any FFP-status 2) when graduated from senior high, i got the choice of a Breitling watch or flying as chaperone with grandma on SQ from AMS-SIN-SOC in Rafless Class vv. as a graduation present. Needless to say my natural curiosity about what happens behind the curtain when it closes inflight made me choose instantly for the latter option! Unfortunatly it was the age of no digital cameras so i don't have any pictures of it! SQ website gives this as information about SKL Amsterdam: http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...es/skl_ams.jsp Welcome to SilverKris Lounge - Amsterdam Take a break from your travels - come and enjoy our SilverKris Lounge. Take advantage of the following: A well-equipped business centre Phone lines for laptop Internet access A wide variety of hot and cold drinks and premium alcoholic beverages A self-service food buffet, including instant noodles, fruit salads, Dutch cookies, and nuts Location Amsterdam Schiphol Airport First Level Between Pier F and E (Airside) Major Facilities Internet Access Luggage Area TV Area Lounge Access (based on departing flight) First Class Business Class Singapore Airlines PPS Club, Solitaire Singapore Airlines PPS Elite Gold, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Star Alliance Gold (please refer to respective membership guides for access conditions) Opening Hours Daily: 0750 to 1150 hours (subject to flight schedule changes) Recalling from my mermories i still remember: 1) Both times the loungedragon was the same tall almost giant blond elder woman who was very friendly in both english and dutch. She asked every guest if she can show the facilities and i did remember she made flight announcments. 2) During my first stay i noticed a very tall decorated christmas tree and christmas adornements across the lounge (we were traveling in the x-mas season then) 3) It's kind of a hike to the SKL when travelling with grandma. It took at least a 15 min walk and ellevator usage because it is on the 2nd level of terminal 3 departures. SQ usually departs from the G-gates which is in elderly terms almost walking the marathon from the SKL. Luckly the lounge dragon called forth a chariot (the cart) so we were driven off to our gate 4) The entrance looks dark but the SilverKris logo is immensely lit-up visible behing the lounge dragon's desk 5) Drinks included alchoholic as far as i remember Bailey's, Grand Marnier and red / white wine. Softdrinks were available canned from the fridges. Water was bottled in Evian and Perrier. Napkins and wedges of lemons were available. Coffee and hot water were available from machines as well as an assortiment of different tea bag flavours. All was self-service. Cutlery surprisingly was of First Class; the heavy silver/steel like ones. (I still have some in drawers at home, i was allowed to take those when i asked politly kinda embarrassed) 6) Foodwise, Dutch stroopwafels and other biscuits were available and instant cupnoodles. I can't remember clearly if sandwiches were offered but i do know no hot foods were available. (As SQ leaves mornings from AMS and the Dutch usually have a continental breakfast, hot foods would be kind of a waste) 7) Lounge had dark blue sofas, 4 grouped around a round table. Toilettes are available inside the lounge and the handtowels were soft fluffy ones and not of the brown recyclable sawdust paper variety at Amsterdam airport. The 17th December 2008 i will visit this lounge again with mr. Allegro25 Sr. Are there any special requests or details i should photograph, observe, ask, try, write about etc. for you guys? I know Amsterdam is only a secondary EU-destination city so this SKL might not be visited that often by others but nevertheless i still think it deserves to be spotlighted. Moreover after a quick search on google i found out SQ is the ONLY star alliance carrier with its own lounge at AMS making it automatic the only *G lounge available at Ams. If internet is available i will try to post directly from the lounge itself on the 17th. ",0

" Originally posted by CGK View Post From the leaflet of PPS Changes: In my opinion, Scenario A would not work because of the clause five consecutive years . Dear SQFAN, I disagree with CGK's interpretation. I believe Scenario A works just fine. There is the clause ""five consecutive years."" However, that is directly preceded by ""within."" Were this to say 250,000 and 5 consecutive years PPS, then you would be restricted in achieving PPS until a five year period had passed. However, this is not the case. It is merely saying that you have 5 years to reach that threshold, and in the event you are unable to do so, you do not reap the benefits of solitaire. The closest analogy i can consider is paying a car loan on a 0% interest period. As long as you pay back the car within, say, 24 months, you are fine.... you don't have to wait until 24 months have passed to gain title to the car if you have paid it back within 4 months. Once you have reached the 250,000SGD threshold, you are eligible to receive the benefits of solitaire status- as long as that threshold did not take LONGER than 5 years to achieve. ",1

If there were more security staff on duty it would make the process far more painless.

And if its non-SIN based, on 48hrs stopover, I can imagine them being too bored in transit & TPR after 24hrs and decides to go out and come back again.

Personally I think I will replace the Citi Plat now with the Citi Rewards and get a UOB Visa PPV (for my NTUC groceries & online shopping). BTW, Redmart online shop for groceries would count as online shopping? Anyone knows? That would be good use for UOB Visa PPV too. Well, thanks to the excellent threads at FT for both KF (SG-based cards) and AM (HKG-based cards), I have developed a habit of sourcing for the best cards for the transactions that can generate the most miles for me (such as airlines, online, overseas, and PayWave). Even right now after relocating back to SG for almost a year, I am still generating decent miles for my HKG-based cards due to their generous promos (exp for overseas transactions) for AM/Avios redemptions. On the other hand, I don't really pay that much attention to the dining card (UOB PP AE) as there's quite a number of restrictions on the use of that card and I don't really generate that many transactions from dining anyway. Thanks for the tip for Starhub...not much difference (only $0.10/mile difference) and I still want to generate some miles for the DBS Altitude since there's a minimum balance required for miles redemption.

" I've been curious about this subject for a long time... When the current numbering format appeared with the introduction of Krisflyer 10 or 11 years ago, I was a member of Passages, ex-SIN, and was NOT a PPS member, and was assigned an 855 XXX XXXX, KF blue card. A lot of the numbers I see on luggage tags seem to be 800, 810, etc. A friend of mine was ex-Australia, was an existing TPP, yet was assigned an 855 number, very close to mine. Another friend joined in 2004 or 2005, was blue until last year, and has an 800 number. Any idea what is/was the numbering logic?? ",1

" That stinks. So now it gives 1 treats point per 1$ meaning 0.4mls? Hmm, I don't have Premiermiles and UOB is out of the question. I guess paying for everything via EZlink is again a case by case decision. Well I sent feedback / complaint already to Maybank (not that I expect much out of it). I mean maybe reduce it to 5x treat's points or so, but fully removing it without even communicating is rubbish. Just for 5x treats points (2 KF mls) per 1$ spending abroad the card may not really be worth it I'm wondering as other cards will give you the same. Happy to hear the experts thoughts. BTW, unrelated to above. Citibank is really trying hard to switch Citibank Platinum Card members to the Rewards Infinite card. Given that I don't shop at most of the 10x rewards outlets they have signed up (other than department stores) and no extra earning for super markets I will stick to the Platinum card until they kill it.

I still remember, I was initially just a few thousand short and they still rejected me. Unlike POSB... its Everyday card is a plat card Amex is everything but consistent. Platinum cards used to be ""on invitation only"" but existing card holders could ""inquire"" to get invited for a fee. Finally, both was waived and even newbies were able to apply for Platinum. The income threshold is not fixed. Amex Singapore is cheating on customers as they market the term ""Platinum"" pretty aggressively - only the American Express Platinum Charge Card has all the features that come with the ""true"" Platinum Card (e.g. Gold Membership with Starwood, access to the Fine Hotels & Resorts program). All other cards are just misleading - I was pretty upset when I found out that the ""Platinum Reserve Card"" is one of these fake Platinum cards without the ""real"" Platinum features.

" Hi all, I made some hasty redemptions as my parents are flying through Singapore, and are stuck for a day so I thought I'd spend the day with them to show them around and take care of them. Using my points, I booked DRW-SIN J One Way (40k points Saver) SIN-DRW J One Way (65k points Advantage) The only available flights for redemptio are a week apart, and I didn't realise how EXPENSIVE hotels were, especially since I'm on my own without my wife to split the costs. If I'm there for seven days - and given I spent a week there a few months ago with some buddies on a drinking trip - it's hard to justify spending the entire time there. In hindsight, I wish I'd booked some time away. Basically, I'd like to go to Bangkok for a few days, and cross going to Jai Fai off my list (along with a lot of cocktail bars from the Asia Top 50 list). Looking at redemption options, what can I do to enable the following changes: DRW-BKK J One Way (2-3 day stopover) BKK-DRW J One Way (1 day stopover or no stopover) I have the DRW-SIN-DRW section confirmed, but now that segment is waitlisted, whereas there's still plenty of capacity/redemption for the SIN-BKK-SIN routes.

All Saver award levels remain unchanged but for Zone 11 onwards the Business and First Savers have all increased. With the revision of destinations by zones and also the change of required miles, I think this pretty much clearly shows the opening up of business and first savers.

Exception was the case explained above where ""O"" (744) got changed to ""R"" (388), hence looked commerical, hence got access to the TPR. Makes sense?

" Hi all, I'm new to Singapore and wondering whether the AMEX rewards card's 5x points categories and selections work out to a better deal than the PremierMiles or KF AMEX cards? From the reading here, it's 1.6 KF miles for every S$1, whereas from my calculations it's 3.125 KF miles for every S$1 (5 MR pts for every S$1, 1000 KF for 1600 MR pts). Since you can choose 5 categories to earn on, I'm tempted to push most of my spend to this card if my math is right. The kicker for me is the top-up. According to the site: ""IF I DONT HAVE QUITE ENOUGH POINTS FOR A REWARD, IS IT POSSIBLE TO BUY THEM? Yes. You can top up your points at just S$30 for 1,000 Membership Rewards points. Each purchase top-up has to accompanied by a reward redemption. Terms and conditions apply."" So by my reckoning, you can purchase pts at 33.3... to S$1. I'm really curious to see what those terms are and if they keep that up for long. Anyone else come to this conclusion? Cheers! ",1

" Just to share my recent experience. In the last few weeks, I've travelled very regularly to SIN-MNL-SIN on economy. I usually do MNL-SIN on a Friday. All 3 flights on Fridays are always full on economy. In fact, if you make your commercial booking late, you're unlikely to get a seat on a Friday flight. I'd say that 8 out of 10 times, I'd been op-up on the Friday MNL-SIN flight. It does not matter what's the booking class - most of the time, I pay the cheapest ""E"" class. I think SIA does its upgrade based on the seniority profile of its PPS members and this selection is automated (ie. not up to the ground staff). I normally call up SIA the day before to check how much overbooking they'd had. Sometimes, its as bad as ""more than 10"". Sometimes they'll say ""overbooked but not too bad"". So sometimes I get the op-up during check-in itself; and sometimes, I only get it at the gate. The other sector that's very popular is Monday's SIN-MNL morning flight. I also know SQ2 SIN-HKG to be very popular as well. So my experience with SQ so far tells me that to get op-up, choose a very popular flight and even then, you do need very senior PPS status. ",1

" I can't know for sure if the number of Saver awards had been reduced but I'd also found it slightly more difficult than previously, to snag Saver awards. Anecdotally, I noticed that after SIA becomes a transfer partner for Amex for USA credit card holders (and then expanded to other credit cards in the USA), it seemed to have make things more difficult. So it could be that a larger pool of people now becomes eligible to snag Saver awards. As everyone knows, credit cards in the USA are very generous on points award. To get around this, if the travel is important, I'll book Standard award, but do a separate booking to waitlist on Saver. Usually, the closer to the date of travel, it may open up. Then I just cancel the Standard award, swop it out of the Saver. ",1

Let's say hypothetically one requalifies for QPP in January. Annual PPSV counter is reset to zero, but cumulative PPSV is $240k. Then 3 months later, in March, after accumulating an additional $10k in PPSV, the cumulative counter crosses $250k. Does one then get a full 12 months of TPP from that point?? 2 years ago when I first qualified for TPP, I actually re-qualified for QPP just 1 month prior. When I got my TPP, I did have a full 12 months membership. So, congratulations in advance for your TPP although TPP has now devalued greatly. ",1

" Originally posted by matt_will_fix_it View Post Ok - so it was my understanding that award flights never get miles (unless you have a paid Y or C ticket & redeem an upgrade)... I booked a redemption booking online for myself & my fiancé (with me been the Kris flyer member using the miles, and my fiancé as the nominee). I didn't expect either of us to get any miles credited for the trip... and I confirmed this for my account - nothing showing up on my statement. But what surprised me was my fiancé had the miles & tier bonus credited to her account!! I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes! Apart from being extremely jealous, Im now wondering if I should say anything & see if I can get miles credited too, or just keep quiet and hope no-one notices the mistake. Is this a loophole in the system? Or just a lucky co-incidence? if you go into a store with your fiancee, and you both pay for something separately. both items cost $10. she pays first, handing the person a $10 bill. the cashier accidentally gives her back $10. you pay for your item and do not receive any change back. there are now three possible scenarios: 1. inform the person that your fiancee accidentally received $10 back. 2. keep your mouth shut and pocket the money. 3. inform the cashier that you are also deserving of the $10 back because of your winning smile and natural good charm. scenario 1 is the right thing to do. scenario 2 is what most people would do. scenario 3 is a precursor to a feature special on america's dumbest criminals.

There is now a special stand with all te sandwiches on as well as quite a selection of cakes. The wine has been moved there as well. Over where the wine used to be, and were the spirits still are, they have put a blind at the back to 'fence it off' from the open lounge. Looks pretty good. Also noted a few more flavours of ice cream. Chocolate and vanilla are still listed as being available, but sadly there was no chocolate in there yesterday. Had to make do with vanilla, macadamia (basically vanilla with pieces of macadamia nuts in it), cookies & caramel, and strawberry cheesecake. There are now no less than two ice cream fridges - the original one over by the spirits, and a new one near the tea/coffee machine. On the down side, there wasn't much of a selection of teas available yesterday - only English breakfast and Earl Grey. Also the freshly cut fruit has gone.

 It depends on how one looks at it. I tend to see a more developed form of the lounge development. The TPC has personalized service and the items on the menu are more refined than previous First although I believed Krug or DP is probably not on the drink list. Personally felt the T3 First Class lounge is better than any previously in Singapore. I agreed that the phasing out of the Krisflyer lounges worldwide is a dilution of the overall premium travel experiences. The one lounge I missed was the one at Incheon and the Asiana lounge comes no where near it in my opinion. The deletion of the PVG lounge was another one that was replaced by a lower standard Shanghai Airlines Lounge. We paid for the SQ's experiences and not Shanghai Airline or Asiana experiences. ,1

I know that in Y class, i sometimes prefer the kids' meal to the adults', but wondering if it's the same for J class. Thanks! ",0

" 225, A Warm Welcome to SQTalk. I don't have any specific recommendations. On EK, do bear in mind there is a stop over in Dubai and not a great stopover according to some folks. Not sure how many flights they have a day but previously, they have a very early morning departure, which was not my cup of tea. On SQ, upgrades opportunities are limited. I am not a big fan of TG due to their aircraft changes and my previous experiences were not good service wise but it does come with wonderful J Class fares. On the overall, I think there is no perfect choice and will depend on what you looked for. ",1

In appreciation of your longstanding support as a PPS Club member of 18 years, we are pleased to present you a one-time award of S$XX,XXX in Reserve Value, which can be used towards your membership renewal in subsequent years.

" Originally posted by zvezda View Post Thank you! Now the question is how to keep it. The rules are not clear on what happens if one fails to earn S$25K every year. One drops from Solitaire to nothing, but then does earning it back require just the S$25K in a year or does it require S$250K in five years? If the latter, do they count the S$s spent within the last five years prior to Solitaire lapsing? That Cumulative PPS Value does not apply (according to the rules) to Solitaire members seems to suggest not. The rules are pretty clear. If a TPP fails to spend S$25k in the next qualifying year the TPP is demoted to QPP. If as a QPP you fail to spend S$25k then the QPP is demoted to KFG or KFS dictated by the miles travelled. A demoted TPP (now QPP) who spends $25k should be given TPP status back again. If demoted to KFG then would have to spend $250k in five years to requalify for TPP. ",1

Now of course, we are all well aware of SQ's recent track record of doing things as cheaply as possible, and of course it could well be that 'ONG&ONG was selected following an extensive tender exercise involving the participation of both local and international design firms' because they were the cheapest, just like the new website creators.

Not even D fare which is deep discount Business Class. This bonus is to be expected as SQ27/28 load in C has dropped significantly. My recent SQ28 flight was less than half full in C. It used to be hard to get a J/D seat, now you can get an empty seat next to you. I really don't understand SQ management. They are killing this route slowly. They need to either roll back the changes or drop this route later. If you didn't follow this 27/28 saga; SQ has almost doubled the fare over the past 18 months, switched to older aircraft (77W to 772ER) and reduced frequency (7x weekly to 5x weekly and to 4x weekly).

" Originally posted by sqdazz View Post A real smack in the face for people who fly economy and earn star gold status, particularly Krisflyer's own star golds, who now will not be able to easily shower or use a private toilet when flying a route like MEL-SIN-LHR where the shower mid way through is absolutely ESSENTIAL to me. I am bloody disgusted in Singapore Airlines actually, what other airline on earth does this at their major hub? I do not know of any. In fact SQ can go and get stuffed, I simply won't use them for long haul connections through SIN in Y in future. Cathay will let me into the F lounge in HKG as oneworld Emerald, and Qantas will allow me the same in SYD and MEL flying Y where I can not only have a shower but I can also grab a facial for earning top tier status. Thai have showers in the *Gold lounges and they are quite nice too. I am assuming Malaysia offer the same? I will use them once they join oneworld instead of SQ. SQ has almost lost me completely, Thai is now superior in almost every respect in economy class. well to me is that they do not ""value"" much on the Y pax. That's why I posted before asking if not so ""infrequent"" F/C really worth much more than very ""frequent"" Y customer? I think for SQ the answer is yes. ",0
" Originally posted by SilverChris View Post It just means the fuel surcharge will be factored into the base fare of a ticket instead of being a seperate fee. It's not being done away with, per se. This primarily benefits redemption tickets because the miles cover the base fare, which in turn covers the fuel surcharge. Although, whether this is a nett positive after the increase in burn rates, is debatable. It'll be good if claiming a redemption in low season and one has plenty of miles. Last year I booked YX return to SIN and it cost me 70% of the paid fare because most of it was fuel surcharge. ",1
 I love SQ and they've treated me well all these years so no complaints here. Just wished they could be a little less rigid.

" Actually UA/AC DO fly to Australia! They fly DAILY SFO-SYD and LAX-SYD on the 744 with one of the 744's in addition makes a daily round-trip SYD-MEL while in Australia. Note that due to bilateral rights between Oz/US you CANNOT book the daily SYD-MEL sector separately and must be booked in addition to a trans-pacific flight (you must route SFO-SYD-MEL or LAX-SYD-MEL) on UA/*A or YVR-SYD-MEL I believe on AC/UA. Air Canada ALSO files DAILY to Oz now with daily YVR (Vancouver)-SYD (Sydney) flights that start in YYZ (Toronto, same B77L actually, first part is domestic sector). They also fly to SIN daily with the continuation of YYZ/YVR/YYC/SFO/LAX/ORD/IAD-NRT-SIN and/or YYZ/YVR/SFO/ORD-HKG-SIN. Note that there will be some scheduled aircraft swaps soon but you will be protected as long as you have booked. This is FAR LONGER as it routes via East Asia versus the non-stop North America West Coast/Australia/NZ non-stops that go south-west versus west THAN south. The fastest way to Oz on UA/AC/*A from North America is either the following from YYZ: YYZ-LAX/SFO-SYD-MEL on UA completely YYZ-YVR-SYD-MEL on UA/AC. Note that ONLY Qantas flies non-stop from MEL to North America with the LAX-MEL DAILY with 4 of them weekly being an A380 the rest a 744ER. MEL is just too far from West Coast North America for a standard 744 to run full-payload and must run with a 777/A340/A380 or Qantas special 744ER they bought to run this sector. You shouldn't have cancelled YYZ-SFO. Though UA doesn't have PTV's on their 744's on their SFO/LAX-SYD/MEL sectors unfortunately. If I were you I would just book Air Canada AC33 DAILY YYZ-YVR-SYD with UA SYD-MEL or buy a tag-on on QF or Jetstar or whatever LCC is in Oz at the moment. Note that due to competition and increased tourism/BUSINESS between Oceania and North America the FLIGHTS NON-STOP between Oz and USA/Canada and REALLY FULL at the moment and the companies are charging SKY-HIGH fares (Like Air Canada's $1500-$2000 YYZ-YVR-SYD and AC is making good profits with the B77L DAILY now!). You can also route via NZ with ANZ flying YVR-AKL 2x/weekly and SFO-AKL 5x/weekly (744) and LAX-AKL 2x daily (one of which continues on-to London via the Western hemisphere, aka USA/Canada). The ONLY reason and the popularity of going the long way ALL the way to East Asia transiting to Oceania is because of CHEAPER FARES. Even though competition has increased on LAX/SFO/YVR-SYD/AKL/MEL/BNE non-stops it's still capacity constrained. That's why QF is flying the A380 MEL/SYD-LAX non-stop and 4x weekly DFW-BNE-SYD (reverse is non-stop due to head-winds, this may switch to an A380 soon). Los Angeles-Melbourne non-stop is 15 hours IIRC. If you want the absolute FASTEST routing time-wise it would be with OneWorld QF/AA of YYZ-LAX-MEL and reverse. If you want to skip the USA transfer and do direct Canada-Australia you can fly AC33/34 which runs YYZ-YVR-SYD daily and buy a separate or combined PNR on-to MEL. Or go via NZ and do YYZ-YVR-AKL-MEL. Your choice. ",1

Unless they consider banning QPP's in Raffles from using the F side their bizarre way of improving things. From what we understand from the plans, the lounge in T3 is going to be nothing special either... Hmmm... for me SKL F is much better than SKL J. The J side is much darker and food offering is (IMO) much worse in terms of selections especially, and is much harder to find a space in. But yes, even SKL F is nothing compared to CX's The Pier. ",1

For my flights on SQ, I can use my banked flyer miles. After next year's lay-off, i would then switch most of my travels back to SQ and try to hit the 25,000 SGD and re-claim solitaire.

" You should receive miles in terms of 100% of actual distance flown. If you are booking on the UA site, look under 'Details' when you get to the page to select your flight. From my experience, the Premier Qualifying Miles (PQM) has corresponded to the actual distance between origin and destination, and I have had that number of miles credited to my Krisflyer account following a flight on UA regardless of ticket price. Well, almost the exact miles. I have noticed receiving a few miles less than the actual great circle distance between origin and destination. ",1

" Originally posted by LionCity View Post There is no perfect Frequent Flyer program nor perfect airline around. For example I found some of the CX's aircrafts are older and the inflight cabin crew are louder those from SQ. The food on CX while good, I don't find it fantastic. Being on Jet Airways, good personal touches but some cabin crew seems clumsy and cabins (back in October) not that fantastic (without personal video screens). I noticed our my recent flights to PVG that I am starting to see more of the younger version of the 777 regional with AVODs as compared to the past (it maybe purely more chance though). I think SQ is making a concerted effort to upgrade her fleet faster than many other airlines. Overall, cabin service is still very good and have no serious complaints. On the ground service (the side that I always complained about), I think SQ is making a strong effort to improve. I found that my recent calls to reservations are answered faster now rather than the busy tones. The staff seems also to make more effort to help passengers. While agreeing that some the PPS changes are necessary due to the program being too successful, I felt it has been overdone with corresponding reduction in benefits to save a few bucks. Very well said LionCity. There is no forum and no loyalty program people don't complain about. Everywhere there are cutbacks, wether in frequent flier programs or hotel programs. It's the way things go and we can go or stay. It is after all the airlines choice which direction they want to go just like any other business, small or large will make decisions. Some will be wise and a good move and some maybe not. We, in this case, the consumer are lucky enough to have so many choices, if we don't like SQ we can move to CX or any other airline that suits our needs. I have been a little dissappointed with the PPS changes recently but have adapted and found that SQ is still a wonderful and probably my favourite airline and Krisflyer still is a very good frequent flier program for me, even if I just stay QPPS or Elite Gold. Their redemption levels are quite good, especially with the 15% discount when booked online. So far I have been able to get the flights I wanted, much easier and better then a couple of other programs I was trying ot use my miles. Recently I have often had to deal with the calling centre in India, dialing the local Canadian number but not have had any negative experience, the opposite, it's always been pleasant and helpful. Service on board too has been consistant, though their have been a couple of flights that could have been better but still were satisfying. I am not a Solitaire nor have I ever been one, so I appologize if this is somewhat not approriate for me to comment in this thread but just wanted to express my thoughts on this. ",1

But I'm sitting in it right now, and typing from it too. And the first thing I did, after getting a water to dry out from the first sector, was sit down and login to SQtalk. Totally revamped. I showed my transit card and BP at the desk, thinking nothing afoot, and walked in, only to find myself totally plussed (ant. non-plussed) by the lounge, getting only a few feet before going back to the boy at the desk to inquire, ""I was here a week ago. This is totally different, right? I haven't lost my mind, have I?"" ""Yes, totally different. Please, come on in..."" So, the color scheme is very much like the new F, and the materials and such are like what you'd find at SIN T3. Somewhat oddly, there is still a front desk with two sides to pass through when entering, but both sides lead to the same room, which is a long deep room with computer terminals-- tons of them-- looking vaguely like a trading floor. (They wanted the full HKG look, no?) Behind that, is a wet bar with refreshments and a compact seating area. For additionaly seating areas, you can go fairly far to the left, and fairly far to the right, giving the whole thing a suggestion of caverns with no discernable end (Think, Indiana Jones, Episode III, catacombs of Venice scene, sans rats.) On the whole, I'd say it a marked improvement from the worn-out, wrung-out, tired old thing we all came to know, love, and hate whilst in transit on SQ 001/002. Still no ramp/airfield view.

Here is the partial info from the T&C (Source: SQ website): 25. Star Alliance Upgrade Awards a. Requests of these awards must be made through KrisFlyer Membership Services or Singapore Airlines City Ticket Offices, in accordance with procedures that may be enforced from time to time for issuing awards. b. Travel agencies cannot issue Star Alliance Upgrade Awards. c. Standby upgrades at the airport are not permitted. d. KrisFlyer miles must be valid when an award ticket is issued. For this reason, members should ensure that ticketing takes place before the KrisFlyer miles expire. Members must ensure that they have sufficient miles in their account before an award ticket is issued. A child nominee requires the same number of KrisFlyer miles as an adult for the redemption award. e. Members must report any suspected unauthorized award claims from their KrisFlyer account within three months of the unauthorized transaction activity for any corrective action to be possible. f. All KrisFlyer miles required for an award ticket must be earned by the same member, under the same account number. g. Travel on KrisFlyer award tickets is subject to capacity controls. This may limit the number of seats available for free travel on particular flights. Award seats may not be available on all flights or in all classes. In addition, some partners may impose blackout periods when award redemption is not permitted. h. Members can only use KrisFlyer miles to redeem awards. Award redemption cannot be combined with any other means of payment. i. A passengers use of an award is subject to the Terms and Conditions set by both the issuing airline and the airline providing the carriage. l. Upgrades are available to the next higher class of service. Double class upgrades are not permitted. j. All carriage on and all tickets issued on behalf of an airline are subject to each airlines Conditions of Carriage, copies of which may be obtained directly from the airline. k. Industry discount, agency discount, free or award tickets cannot be used for upgrade awards redemption. l. Upgrades are available to the next higher class of service. Double class upgrades are not permitted. m. Miles earned for travel using an upgrade award will be based on the original class of service purchased. n. Eligibility for the Star Alliance Upgrade Awards depends on the booked commercial class and the participating carrier. This is according to the table below. A confirmed booking on the eligible class is required in order to request for Star Alliance Upgrade Award redemption. Participating Carrier Eligible Booking Class for Economy Class to Business Class Upgrade Eligible Booking Class for Business Class to First Class Upgrade Air New Zealand Y, B No First Class All Nippon Airways Y, B C, D, J, Z Asiana Airlines Y, B C, D Austrian Y, B No First Class LOT Polish Airways Y, B No First Class Lufthansa Y, B C, D Thai Airways Y, B C, D SWISS Y, B C, D o.

The participating carriers are Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, Austrian, LOT Polish Airways, Lufthansa, Thai Airways and SWISS as well as such other Carriers as may be advised from time to time. q. Up to four passengers in a single booking can be upgraded using miles from 1 KrisFlyer account. Partial upgrade of passengers within a booking is not allowed. If KrisFlyer members wish to upgrade some passengers within the booking, the commercial booking will need to be split accordingly. r.

" Originally posted by 259850 View Post I tried searching the history, but I'm not sure if it will answer my questions. I had close to 200 cumulative PPS sectors at the point of rule change to PPSV. These got converted to ~200,000 cumulative PPSV. If I understand the rules correctly, I had another 5 years from 1 Sep 07 to accumulate the remaining 50,000+ PPSV. Questions: What happens if I fail to qualify as QPP in one of the ensuing years? Will the Cumulative PPSV be reset to 0? I'm hoping that all I have to do is to be QPP at the point of attaining the 250k PPSV. Firstly, you only have 4 years from 1 Sep 07 to get the 50K PPSV. The moment you lose QPP, your cumulative PPSV is reset to 0. ",1

" Originally posted by SQ228 View Post Thank you for this information, it is quite helpful to frame my mind for what I'm going to experience. It was either a 3.5 hour or an 11 hour connection. I'm pretty good at entertaining myself if I need to and I don't get bored easily, so I'd rather arrive relaxed knowing I can't miss my next flight than racing through an unpredictable environment, worrying about forfeiting 75k miles if I don't make it in time. I'm not overly optimistic about CA check-in agents in TSE wanting to check my bags through to MEL, or PEK's ability to handle them correctly, so now I have plenty of time to cover that factor. If the lounge is drab, at least I can find a quiet corner to sit and read in and I'll be happy. I thought about your problem a little more. If it were me, here's what I would do: 1) In TSE, try and convince the agent to check you through all the way. CA agents in 2nd/3rd tier cities in China were able to do this for me. The issue with CA is not competence, but attitude. But then again, in TSE, it may have been outsourced. So if it fails.... 2) ....and your flight lands on time in PEK, speak to the SQ check-in agent to see if they can move you to the earlier flight - SQ805 I believe. A 773 might be a downgrade from a 380, but it still beats sitting 10 hours in the PEK lounge. Moreover, this flight gets substituted with a 77W frequently. Who knows, it may become permanent in another 6 months. But if that fails.... 3) ....check in to your scheduled SQ807. If you're not knackered and feeling adventurous, hop on the airport express and spend time downtown. Even if it is only for 3-5 hours, a simple walk in the park can be pleasant, especially in spring. But if you are knackered.... 4) ......walk out of T3. There are 2 decent airport hotels within walking distance - Hilton and Langham. They're about the same. There are shuttle buses if you don't feel like walking (it is near enough, but not well-marked). Order a drink and sit in the lobby lounge. Don't go through immigration until at most 90 minutes before your flight. ",1

" You have enough time to go lounge-hopping.

Depending on the time of the day you're going and your personal preference, I'd recommend visiting the TG C lounge first (only snacks here), then visiting the SKL for more substantial food (use the free internet if you need to), then if you want, lounge-hop to other TG lounges perhaps for a shower to refresh yourself before finally heading for the Royal Orchid Spa for a complimentary 30 minute massage of head/neck or foot massage before heading for your departure gate.

Want to advise that I am not a PPS member. The process was seamless. To OP, very recently I have flown SQ F in 6 sectors and I have to say in almost all of them (except 1) I was greeted by my last name entering the aircraft and was escorted to my F seat by a FA and a 2nd FA taking my jacket or helping me store my 22"" TUMI carry-on and laptop bag in the overhead bins. I usually book seat 2A on the 747's and the overhead bins on the inside are on a curve therefore it needs some help to fit a 22"" carry-on. Point I am making is that even though I am not a PPS member, the greeting by name, escorting me to my seat, helping me with my jacket and my carry-on as soon as got to my seat IS FIRST CLASS service. I have flown several airlines in various classes and SQ IMHO is far ahead of the rest and best in class. ",1

" http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122938527117608795.html How Savvy Fliers Make the Most of Their Miles Airlines say the most-frequently used frequent-flier award is the basic domestic coach ticket. But that's also the award with the lowest value per mile for consumers. Savvy travelers do better: The secret is to upgrade. On average, experts say, consumers are getting only about 1.2 cents per frequent-flier mile when they cash in awards. But you can stretch your miles and get four times as much value or more out of your frequent-flier account by getting out of the coach cabin. At most major airlines, a domestic upgrade costs 15,000 miles each way, or 30,000 miles round-trip. Several airlines have added $50 fees each way as well. But consider the cost of buying a first-class ticket, and you see the value of the miles. For a New York-San Diego trip next month, for example, you can find a coach ticket as low as $319 on AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, and the cheapest first-class ticket is $2,029. Use miles to upgrade instead of buying first-class tickets and, even after paying $100 in fees, you get more than five cents for each mile. International upgrades pay off even more. For a Chicago-Frankfurt trip next month on UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, you can buy a coach ticket as low as $697 or a business-class ticket for $5,624. Instead of paying nearly $5,000 more for the business-class seat, you can spend 60,000 miles for a round-trip upgrade. The cheapest coach fare eligible for that upgrade is $1,001, so you have to spend $304 more on the ticket. But even after factoring that in, the savings you get through miles work out to nearly eight cents per mile. The lure of a business-class seat is so great that some travelers find ways to barter miles from people with more miles than they will likely use. United will add co-pay fees to its upgrade awards starting July 1. Those fees -- which are also levied by other airlines -- can be hefty. At American, an upgrade between North America and Europe costs 50,000 miles round-trip -- cheaper than United's price, but you have to pay $700 round-trip in co-payments to upgrade most discounted coach tickets. At Continental Airlines Inc., an upgrade to Europe from the U.S. costs only 40,000 miles round-trip, but the co-payment fees can run as high as $1,000 round-trip. The value you get for the miles can still be strong, however. The upgrade strategy works particularly well now because premium seats should be more available: Companies have restricted travel expenses and forced more business travelers to ride in the coach cabin, so airlines are selling fewer business-class and first-class seats. That should leave more inventory of upgrade awards. Still, travelers often complain about the scarcity of available upgrade awards. The best strategy for booking a cushy seat with miles is to be flexible: Travel at off-peak times, perhaps on less-popular flights, and be willing to take connecting flights instead of non-stops. Getting better value for your miles often requires a significant shift in your travel mindset. Many travelers want as many trips as possible out of their miles and chase as many discounted coach trips as they can squeeze out of their mileage accounts. But since the cost of an upgrade is often about the same as the cost of a coach ticket, or less, many travelers find they can use miles to vastly improve their travel experience. Quality over quantity matters in airline travel. The lure of comfort is so strong that road warriors with fat frequent-flier accounts try to buy international business-class seats with miles straight-up. Russ Wiley of Colorado Springs, Colo., flew on Delta Air Lines Inc. from Denver to Brussels and back last month for 95,000 miles instead of paying more than $7,000 for the ticket. That's more than seven cents per mile. He recently transferred 270,000 points from his American Express Co. credit-card account to Delta, which gives a 30% bonus on such transfers. With those miles he purchased two business-class tickets to Capetown, South Africa, from Denver -- tickets that usually cost about $10,000 each -- again collecting more than seven cents per American Express point. ""It takes a little planning, but if you work at it, it's not too hard,"" said Mr. Wiley. ""A little flexibility helps."" The lure of a business-class seat is so great that some travelers find ways to buy or barter miles from people with more miles than they will likely use, then cash them in for nice awards. Such schemes can attract the wrath of airlines, which usually prohibit the sale of miles, although they do allow people to book award tickets in anyone's name. One buyer of miles who asked not to be named for fear American would cancel his account pays about 1.3 cents per mile to ""friends"" he finds through Internet postings, then uses the miles for business-class tickets between China and the U.S. worth about six cents to nine cents per mile. ""I call it airline miles arbitrage,"" he said. The scheme, which produces business-class tickets for coach-ticket prices, does require lots of trust for the seller to book an award for the buyer after receiving payment. If you're trying to book awards far in advance, remember that most airlines open booking for seats 330 days before departure. (Upgrades may open up later if premium seats don't sell.) One tip: A Web site called AwardGrabber.com has policies for different airlines, and can calculate when you need to start trying to book for your specific travel date. There are also ways to get the most value out of your frequent-flier points even if you do decide to use them for domestic seats. The key is to use your miles for pricey last-minute tickets for funerals, family emergencies or surprise visits, instead of for long-planned vacations. Last-minute tickets can run $1,000 to $2,000 for domestic trips and buying those tickets with 50,000 miles yields better value. Airlines offer myriad other opportunities to spend miles, though few are a good value. Frequent travelers can buy memberships to airport clubs with miles, for example, but often at prices that convert to less than one cent per mile. An annual membership at United's Red Carpet Club costs $500 for non-elite members of its frequent-flier program, or 70,000 miles. For gold-level members of Delta's SkyMiles program, an annual membership to Crown Room Clubs costs 50,000 miles or $350. Merchandise and gift cards can be an even worse value for frequent-flier miles. Through Points.com, American, Delta, US Airways and many other airlines offers gift cards and merchandise. But a $50 Best Buy gift card will cost you 13,059 American miles, significantly less than one penny per mile. A $50 FTD.com gift card for sending flowers costs 9,412 AAdvantage miles, a lower price but still not a great deal for your miles. Yet the low redemption rates are OK with consumers like Carl Gehr of Cincinnati, who prefers to buy his airline tickets so he qualifies for elite status on Delta, which gets him frequent free upgrades and priority status for rebooking when things go wrong. (Tickets bought with miles don't count toward elite status.) Instead, he uses his miles to give tickets to relatives, pay for his annual Delta Crown Room membership and purchase gifts for family. ",1

 Just another data point. checked SIN - CGK - SIN for Aug - Sep and F on SQ has completely disappeared on ANA at least. LH is the only regularly offered F option from what I can see right now. In C it is a bit of a mixed bag. Past mid Sep it is almost non-existent for SQ and only sporadicaly shows up for a flight here and there. In early Sep and Aug though I can find quite a few days that have several C seats offered on multile SQ flights. Maybe they are really getting stingy on partner airlines award inventory and only release seats to other *A FFPs later now then before.

But if USD/SGD drops to 1.30 in 3 months and 1.20 in 9 months, then this scenario happens: Outbound = USD2500 * 1.30 = 3250 PPSV Inbound = USD2500 * 1.20 = 3000 PPSV Total = 6250 PPSV (loss of 700 PPSV) Of course this is for example only.

My parents and I (3 ppl) are confirmed on SQ12 on 9 July 2010 (business class). Am trying to upgrade to First, but am told by the KF customer service that there is only 1 Saver Award available, and would have to waitlist 2 persons. In your experience, what are the chances of the waitlist being confirmed (as I'm not too keen on splitting us up but may just do so since we've never tried first and also have miles expiring). Also, as my parents do not have enough miles (short of a couple of hundred based on 15% online discount), I was told that an online redemption cannot be made and a redemption based on the full no. of saver miles (w/o discount) would have to be made and the balance miles topped up. Is that the case? Thanks in advance for your help! ",1

" I've mostly only been to the main Business and First Silverkris lounges in T3, only once to the Krisflyer Gold one so I can't comment on the latter. But for the former, the Business lounge gets crazy crowded in the early mornings and late evenings. It looks classy, and has decent food and beverage but that's it. Looking at what's been released of the planned revamp so far, I understand there will be a 30% increase in capacity but that is not going to cut it and surely they have plans to grow in capacity like any other business? Have the SQ execs been to the lounge at 11 PM on any day? You can barely get a seat. With a 30% increase in space, it's still going to be super crowded. You should have ample space in a flagship lounge of a premium airline and not have to squeeze for crying out loud. And it looks like the highlight is the bar which is what just about every other airline lounge has already. Hell even the pay-per-use Plaza Premium lounge has one. I'm not hopeful it's going to be anything special. Knowing SQ, their idea of ""innovation"" and ""enhancement"" is probably not going to extend much beyond 30% more seats and that bar, and definitely not anything that would increase the cost of maintaining the lounge, with like say a spa. They can't even be bothered to come up with a decent arrangement for the nearly 2 years that their lounges would be out of commission, funneling all their Business and First passengers into that very basic lounge that's a quarter of the size of the main complex ",0

" Originally posted by SQ LPP View Post Every flyer has a different month of the year in his/her membership. So we could guess that there would be a flaw in the system. The different membership month plus using current year PPSV instead of lifetime cumulative PPSV actually has the overall benefit of introducing some randomness to the whole op-up game. Are you sure it's based on tier and then PPSV, as opposed to just PPSV? If op-ups are based on cumulative PPSV, LPPs will more likely 'win', thus rendering op-ups an expected entitlement for them and dis-incenting others. And since LPPs don't have to worry about requalifying, they could then buy cheap Y fares and hope for an op-up. If op-ups are based on current year PPSV, any PPS, depending on their travel pattern and their luck - their membership month relative to other PPS' membership month on that flight on that particular day - may have a chance at that elusive op-up once in a blue moon. It's certainly better in terms of customer delight for SQ to spread the wealth around, as rare an occurrence as it is, than keep handing out op-ups to LPPs. But if it's based on tier and then PPSV, then LPPs on cheap Y fare will still trump TPPs & QPPs on full fare, which is a bit inconsistent with SQ's focus on awarding current premium passengers rather than legacy.

We would like to inform you that your previous qualification period is from 1 April 2007 up to 30 April 2008 where you were able to accrue 26,119 Elite miles. As such, you were awarded Elite Silver membership on 21 December 2007 and a new Elite qualification period commenced.

On the other hand, an additional accrual of 24,249 Elite miles by 31 December 2008 would qualify you to Elite Gold membership. Ms Matt_Will_Fix_it , thank you for writing in to us.

I found out I am the only passenger in F which means catering onboard would be very limited. I believe the normal dinner menu will be rather less elaborate? Any suggestion? ",0

If you do a Cents Per Mile calculation to work out value for the miles you are spending (there's a lot more detail here: https://hightechflight.com/2016/04/1...es-and-points/), it will almost always show that the greatest value is spending miles on First Class redemptions. Simply put, take the cost you would otherwise have to pay for the ticket, subtract the taxes you will pay for the redemption ticket and divide that value by the miles you are using. The higher this value the better. A really good value redemption will come in at a bout 0.08, 0.09. Thank you! Very useful formula. The first class flight on this route gives about 0.067. ",1

 SQ seems to have missed out on QPPS members again. Requalified 4 months after renewal date of membership and with 40K in PPS Value last year. Members with short fall are renewed automatically and Solitaire are provided with reserve values. I have fallen into the gap between the two. Missed TPPS with change to 250 sector points from 5 years QPPS membership and again with PPS Value of 250 K. I must be a thrice spurned lover. ,1

" We had more than our fill of the Suites experience on SQ308. We were connecting from MEL so the early morning departure didn't bother us for a change. Catering is breakfast followed by a full lunch - with all the bells and whistles like caviar for the lunch service. Mind you they do dim the cabin after the breakfast service for most of the flight so it feels like a night flight anyway. Have some eggs benny with La Grand Dame in TPR whilst waiting for your flight. Settle into your Suite after the obligatory selfies, followed by liberal doses of your choice of Dom or Krug (or both) before take off and after with breakfast. Following brekky, change into your PJs and enjoy a few hours' kip on the super comfy beds (which after all is the point of flying in this cabin - or alternatively, TV in bed). Wake up to enjoy lunch and the IFE with even more of your choice of poison, and land during daylight with nice views of London prior to landing (if you're on the correct side of the aircraft - they usually encourage you to move if there are empty seats which is often the case in Suites).

" Most of my PPSV are very close to the actual fare paid. The exception is when the system cannot determine the PPSV for a particular sector, mostly because of last minute rebooking, use of paper tickets or FIM, then a PPSV based on local fare is used.

They also tell me that if I want caviar on my return F flight from CPH to SIN on 8/7/2018, then I need to cancel my BTC order, which, by the way is only the Japanese BREAKFAST!

He shown me an electronic ticket with a stamp on it regarding the downgrade so that he can put in for a refund of the fare difference. I asked him if he gotten any voucher or compensation, he mentioned clearly there was nothing of that sort. He merely wanted to fly in J and that was what he paid for!! In fact, rather not have a refund. He raised the issue but was merely ignored. I asked him to write in and he mentioned it is a waste of time now. It is because SQ business is so good and they probably will check on his future bookings to see if any threat to do less business with SQ is real. He is hobbled with the choice of airlines. But I noted he is switching to EK for a long leg flight to Europe as they offer a fantastic deal. He added that EK in Dubai has moved to the new terminal with better and larger lounge facilities even though the stopover is longer than the average stopover. He thought he should try that out even SQ cabin staff is better but believed that EK now offers generally better hard ware in Business.

" Hooray, my limbo ended today! Finally, my status is lounge-dragon official again, as my KrisFlyer membership pack arrived today. So here is the summary of the process for a PPS member who downgrades to EG, based on my experience: 1. The elite miles counter reset twice: first when the counter reached 50,000 (back in late December), and then a second time (when my PPS membership lapsed). Loss of elite miles: between 2,000 and 3,000, which were accumulated between the two milestones. 2. The membership pack doesn't get sent out until PPS membership lapses. This means you get that awkward period when you can't back up your *G status with a physical card. Probably less problematic if your travels in this limbo period are on SQ, more problematic if you have the not-so-accommodating lounge dragons in Europe to contend with. 3. You'll get a phone call from KrisFlyer in Singapore after a couple of emails where you ask for a faxed letter certifying your EG status, so that you can use it with the lounge dragons. Nice touch this phone call, but I never did receive that faxed letter. OT: Is this phone call an unpublished benefit for PPS members? In nearly all my dealings with KrisFlyer when I was a QPP with an issue that needed resolution, I was pleasantly surprised by follow-up phone calls from Singapore when I used the website interface. I don't recall ever getting this kind of attention in my EG days. ",1

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post Reserve Value was introduced for TPP because under the new rules, the TPP would need to go for 5 years and 250K PPS Value again once dropped. The rule for TPP never made sense to begin with: why would QPP and TPP only need the same amount to requalify? A TPP could stay TPP for ten years while I am spending the very same amount and be only QPP. Why they introduced PPS Value to QPP is a total mystery to me. Maybe to put some lipstick on the pig instead of rethinking the whole model. To me, they should simplify the rule: 25K in one year gets you QPP and 50K in one year gets you TPP. Once you cross 1000K, you become LPP. No more reserve value, no more difficult rules. Having said that, it's hard to believe that LPP are treated better than TPP. I hardly see any difference from the ordinary pax to QPP. The delta in treatment to TPP would be very marginal and then to LPP cannot be measured. The only time where status matters is on flights (e.g. India) where SQ loads only one (!) specialty meal for First - that's where I always lost out as QPP and the TPP got the meal. I guess when its almost full or full in F and they need to choose who to attend to first, if there are a few TPP and one LPP, they go straight to the LPP and give the LPP all the premium treatment and the rest of the TPP or regular, like you said, are almost the same. The problem comes when there are meals catered and if the LPP who may not fly as much, gets to choose first, whereas a TPP could be a much better customer is way below. I prefer to sit in Row 2 due to the bed mode being wider, so the LPP was in 1C/1D, and there was TPP in 1A and 2C/D, so by the time they got to me at 2F, i got a ""oh sorry, there isn't this available...how about this instead...."" I was like huh.....???? but I just ate whatever else and always have BTC from then on... I understand there are alot of TPP/LPP in F, but shouldn't they then differentiate based on PPSV or something since they got all the iPads with info now....I guess to me they have not done anything for their super frequent flyers, whereas I have heard, even United has a special tier for their top bunch of flyers, above premier 1K....this guy I met travels 3 trips from US to Asia every month and United rolls out the red carpet for him, and he says no matter how bad the service is, he won't switch to SQ or Cathay because their FFP is that good for people like him...SQ seems to only treat people better when they complain, whereas I do want to write a complaint over varying TPP/LPP treatment and get the crew in trouble...

For supper - provided they have enough, they may offer you one of the on-board meals. Beware though - your lobster may not taste very good by then.

All the flights which credited between the time I flew the 250th sector and the time the 250th sector was credited show PPS Value, but that PPS Value is not being counted toward requalification. I phoned SQ and got about seven different answers from five different agents, none of which even remotely made sense until I was transferred to an office dealing specifically with changes to the PPS program. This gentleman was more cogent and understood the problem. He promised to look into it with his supervisors and another department and get back to me ""in a few days."" That was about three weeks ago and no response. Sigh.... If SQ are going to deliberately cheat me out of several thousand S$ of PPS Value (as they have calculated it), then I'm inclined to alternate between Solitaire and PPS by boycotting SQ every other year. Hopefully, SQ will not be so petty. ",1

" I do agree with SQueeze, I do see a lot value in SIA KF program especially now as more programs are being revenue based like UA and AA Being PPS some readers may think I'm off the mark on this point but I think I can relate to the poster concern as I think where its coming from is that based on flying the highest goal is only KFEG. SIA does have higher programs in the name of PPS and Solitaire PPS but this is based on money spent on J fares and above. SIA does not have recognition to flyer who fly Y more often and perhaps maybe even spend more money in Y then a person who fly a few trips in J or F with $25k. I actually had this argument with SIA half a year back when I was Elite Gold and a few $$$ short for my PPS. I mentioned to them that the scheme for PPS and Elite is too way off. Example a person can easily reach PPS just by simply flying 2 times to LHR in F (or maybe another short flight depending on ticket price) and SIA will super value them and give this person PPS, however a person who flies round the world 10 times in Y will only get KFEG and I reckon this person should be more rewarded than the first but in SIA eyes this does not prevail. In my case six month back I asked SIA if were to book one more J flight I'd get my PPS what happens to my Elite Gold privileges since there was a balance of 10 months to the renewal. Would I get entitled to both the privileges of Elite Gold and PPS since their attainment are through separate qualifications one being PPS$ (J fare or above) while the latter being earned through Elite Miles. The answer was pretty much too bad to my Elite Gold status as my PPS status superseded. Well my answer to SQ was too bad to SIA as I stop flying J until my EG status and PPS$ was near the end of cycle for renewal to maximize my EG status privileges. The thing here is that SIA does value its elite FF but only through the PPS program (which would have addressed most of the poster concern) but I would think the main concern here is how they derive / determine what a loyal customer is and they are using sad methodology of $$$ spent in Premium class rather than a long sitting / flying loyal passenger ...

" I am afraid to say that the SKL just doesn't cut it any longer in the bigger scheme of things. Take away the Dom, and I suppose some of the variances of food, and I am afraid it's just another every day average lounge. It may have been a bit of a market leader initially but I am afraid it has been caught up and overtaken by a number of lounges. What has surprised me is, listening to the interviews with the launch of the new inflight products they kept saying how other airlines had launched new products and closed the gap, so they were taking the lead again. If that is so, what are they going to do about the fact that a number of airlines flagship lounges are far better than Changi's SKL, and in some cases blow it away ?. Off the top of my head the lounges that are far better than it are: LH FCL - Now widely believed to be the best in the world CX Wing at HKG - supposedly their biggest rival! VS LHR Clubhouse - other Clubhouses may also be better I don't know, but they own 49% on this lot for heavens sake.... MH KUL lounge - some may disagree with this but take away the Dom and being in here is a far more enjoyable experience. Another local rival to boot. QR have just opened a dedicated lounge for J & F pax and other will undoubtedly follow. I am sure there are others. The answer is not to try and reduce the number of your top tier FF's but to make sure you have sufficient facilities for them.

" Re-qualification period Hi All, I'm new and There's something about the qualification period that I would like to confirm. I was under the impression that if a KF member registers for his account, gets his/her elite status for a year but did not re-qualify after that, the new Qualification period (year) will only restart upon his first qualifying flight (i.e. flight that earns Elite miles). But apparently, KMS told us that the qualification period will start on the first day of the following month after the expiry of the previous Elite Status e.g. 15 Mar 2007 Register for KF 15 Sep 2007 Awarded Elite Silver 30 Sep 2008 Elite Silver expires, did not requalify 01 Oct 2008 Qualifying year Begins 30 Oct 2009 Qualifying year ends 01 Nov 2009 Qualifying year Begins 30 Nov 2010 Qualifying year ends ......

" Originally posted by Dickson View Post My last miracle was J to F upgrade on SIN-MXP several months back. What made it more unusual for me was that the upgrade was issued at check-in itself, not at the boarding gate. The only thing that made me a bit pissed was that the check-in lady PURPOSELY did not allow me to use the Private Room. She made sure to write ""Involuntary upgrade"" on my boarding pass and specifically told me that I cannot use the Private Room, and called up the Private Room to tell them too. I was then travelling with a companion who's booked on First Class on a separate PNR. He got the invite to the Private Room. And we both checked-in at the same time, so she could clearly see we were travelling together. Of course, none of us ended up using the Private Room. While I was happy to be upgraded, I felt that in this case, SQ went out of its way to be petty. Anyone else has a similar experience ?? Wow. I would be annoyed, even insulted. I'd demand to speak to management and that they reprint my BP. I keep each and every single one of them and don't need that clause on my BP. I probably would tell her I don't need the stupid upgrade.

" Originally posted by Spaniard View Post When someone books a ticket whether it is home station or whether carrier X or Y is government subsidized is not the main factor. Value is - and this can take many forms depending on the travelers individual preferences. I see a value differential in SQ's onboard service and the fact that the E3 (or others for that matter) involve a stopover. But the value I get out of loyalty is really low when compared to others. All of these I guess determine that extra amount that different travelers would be able to fork to go a specific carrier and/or travel class. I just find it quite unsustainable to present PEY at the price point it is presented right now when there J options available even though they might involve other inconveniences. And looking at the acceptance PEY is having, they might need to look into it before declaring it failure. Just my 2 cents! No no agreed. That's why in one of my post already mentioned PEY was a mistake. While it's a nice option but the value doesn't present itself. If I want to pay more might as well go J else I'm going to take Y and hopefully at super saver. And comparing super saver with PEY the price is seriously off the mark. SIA is using Y flexi rates to compare with PEY to justify the difference. From SQ perspective yup it may seem good but the general public will never see it that way and look at super saver rates since both super saver and flexi gives you the same product at the end (the other benefits are negligible to them). PEY really presents a problem in terms of branding to carriers as it is a neither here nor there product. It's premium but not premium customer. It's premium but from an economy perspective. It economy + not business - really I would have preferred if they just simply gone without PEY and occasionally reward loyal customers with J upgrade. JAL did something really cool. Read this article http://www.frugaltravelguy.com/2016/...assengers.html If SQ could do something like this I think it would retain loyalty in the long run. PEY looks like a nice product but it's not a product of true value to anyone. ",1

 i just checked my account and also noticed that my pps year has changed to end jan08 instead of feb 08. But i also noticed that there is no line saying how many pps value left for requalification so guess the 25 sectors before 1st sept is enough. ,1
" I've discussed with StarG about this issue a while ago, since this rumor has been circulating underground for a while already... but I've come to the following likely scenarios which I think SQ will do to change PPS: 1st one, which I personally think is most likely and makes the most sense, is that SQ would not change PPS Club as it is right now, but instead add a new unpublished tier like UA UGS or CX Diamond Plus program. However, this would eventually devalue PPS to the point that it'll become useless, like UA 1K. The benefit of doing this is that SQ will not upset too many of its existing customers (the ones who don't surf online looking for FF information all the time), as they would have no idea the new tier exists (you'd be surprised at how many UA mileage plus members have no clue that UGS exists). The benefit though is that they can focus more resources on this new group of people. The other benefit is that they would not need to publish a guideline on how this new super elite tier will be calculated and just say that it is by invitation only, and limit the number of people as they see fit (UA limits it to the top % of fliers by country and the $ amount varies year to year). This would also make sense of get rid of LPPS, as existing LLPS members would probably get lifetime status in this super tier.. 2nd scenario would be that they might change it so that people in certain countries require more sectors to requalify. SIN and CGK based members might require 50 sectors to qualify, whereas other countries will remain at 25. This would be similar to what LH and BA does, which give different requirements depending on where you live. However, one concern will be people who change their address to bypass this, although I don't think it will be too many people outside of SQT, FT, etc.. Last scenario would be that they overhaul PPS completely using a revenue based system as talked about here by this thread. There will however be significant challenges in doing this. SQ will need to disclose how they calculate the revenue so that existing PPS members in order to minimize confusion. As mentioned, it will be difficult for SQ to calculate non SQ stock ticket revenue, RTW tickets, etc. Calculating ticket revenue is a black art that usually only airline account departments can decipher and there will be countless people who will complain that they were shortchanged by SQ, etc.. A lot of frequent travellers who fly on short haul routes will also not make the cut, and someone who only flies one F class roundtrip from the US a year might make it. It will be hard for SQ to justify someone who travels with them only once a year, is more valuable than someone who travels monthly between SIN-HKG in J. I predict if this model is indeed the one that SQ chooses, they will end up with a lot of PPS members based in the US and Europe, and very few left in Asia. It is also likely though, that they might introduce a combination of this scenario and the 2nd scenario, so that different country members will have different $ thresholds. These are just some thoughts I randomly put together.. feel free to discuss.. ",1

Whilst inventory is not blocked yet, you'll have to guess, and that's a 1 in 3 chance you'll get at least one flight on the 380, and a 1 in 9 (I think) chance you'll get both. Yep, I know I have a gamble on my hands with this one - we're happy to accept ""Raffles"" spacebed for this leg (LHR-SIN-LHR), as SIN/Thailand is our holiay destination (and it is, of course, still a great way to fly), but have been planning to gamble on A380 for a SIN-SYD-SIN turnaround just for the experience; this may, as you suggest, be an expensive gamble. It is the latter component of the trip that requires mrs nickbot and I to purchase miles, and also to take a revenue flight from SIN-Thailand (either ChiangMai or HKT). Of course, we're also taking the gamble that one (or, fingers crossed tightly both) of our LHR<->SIN flights are A380 also. Another option is that we can wait until June/July for the trip,...hopefully more A380s will be onstream then... Complicated!! ",1

" Letter to Singapore Airlines Customer Services (1 November 2013) To recap, Singapore Airlines should provide priority boarding for its Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold members. Boarding should be via a clear and designated lane, made available at all airports, including Singapore Changi International Airport – the home of Singapore Airlines. Pre-2012, Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold passengers boarded through the “Priority Lane”, reserved for ""PPS Club; Solitaire; First Class; Business Class; Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold"". This was standardized across all airports worldwide. In my opinion, this was a better and well managed boarding process than now. At most airports today, including Singapore Changi International Airport, Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold members board in the “Normal Lane” for Economy Class passengers. Granted, we get to the front of the pack, after your ground staff’s inspection of our boarding pass. However, has the airline considered: a) how this is perceived by Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold frequent flyers? We board in a “Normal Lane” that is designated for Economy Class. Seriously? b) that this appears disorderly and it adds workload for your ground staff, who might have to deal with unnecessary clarifications from non-frequent flyers, questioning why other Economy Class passengers were able to cut the queue in front of them? [Whilst ground staffs make pre-boarding announcements, explaining the boarding sequence, queue cutting is still visually unpleasant.] I have noted your explanation that there are operational constraints faced by Singapore Airlines at airports. Has your committee therefore: a) clarified with Singapore Changi International Airport why an additional “Priority Lane” for Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold frequent flyers is operationally challenging / unfeasible? b) studied and evaluated how other Star Alliance partners board their priority passengers (includes Star Alliance Gold frequent flyers) – at Singapore Changi International Airport and other Singapore Airlines worldwide destinations? c) discussed with Station Managers on how the boarding process can be standardized and made consistent across all Singapore Airlines destinations? As an example, Hong Kong International Airport “HKIA” has four designated lanes for A380 flights at Gate # 15: “Suites; Business; Priority Lane; Economy Class”. My suggestion is for the airline to consider having two to three designated lanes for boarding at airports: i) “First / Suites” – A380, B777 (certain aircraft types) ii) “Business and Priority Frequent Flyers” – all aircraft types iii) “Economy Class” – all aircraft types In summary, whilst the airline is trying to improve its operational processes, Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold frequent flyers should: a) feel that Singapore Airlines stands out from carriers, and “understands our needs”; b) not feel less appreciated than your PPS Club; and Solitaire “gods”; c) not feel that our entitled benefits have lost its “shine” and are “consolidated” with the masses. For your consideration please. ------------------------------------------------------------ Response from Singapore Airlines Customer Services (21 November 2013) With regard to your comments on priority boarding lanes, we acknowledge your concerns and have highlighted your suggestions to our Ground Services Manager for his consideration. As part of the ongoing review on this, we are pleased to share that our boarding sequence is currently being revised, at the individual cities’ level. In the interim, we will be deploying additional staff at selected parts of Changi Airport to assist with queue-combing. This is with the purpose to direct our KrisFlyer Gold members that may arrive late, to the priority lanes, where possible. Additionally, your recommendations will also be considered in the upcoming new Changi Airport Terminals. Thank you for the opportunity to address your concerns. We recognize that we have to remain mindful of the competition and strive to remain your airline of choice. ",1

" Originally posted by jhm View Post I agree it is ""dishonest"" to agree knowing that I will not comply. However, I think it's too simplistic to say that all such dishonesty is wrong. IMO, people who say this are either lying or they are much better persons than I am. I agree, it's too simplistic. But I also think it isn't a fair characterization of my view on selling miles. A more accurate paraphrase would be, ""Selling miles, when given that it's not allowed by the T&C, is wrong most of the time."" You came up with a perfect example of dishonest behavior that, in the context of selling miles, I wouldn't be troubled with: the unemployed man who sells miles because he had to raise money. It's still dishonest -- this point is a reaction to your previous statements about there being no dishonest behavior in this situation -- but it doesn't trouble me. On the other hand, dishonest behavior motivated by the reasons I read in the previous posts, i.e., (1) SQ maximizes its profits (2) SQ has raised fares x times in a month (3) It's just a contract do not, in my personal calculus, grant exceptions to my stance. Originally posted by jhm View Post It depends on the circumstances. On that we agree. As you pointed out, what we disagree about is a specific circumstance: selling miles. Originally posted by jhm View Post There are things which are clearly wrong by my and most others' standards. There are other things which I would not do myself but I can't criticise those who do (selling of miles is one of them as far as I'm concerned). Finally, there are those things where I am a dishonest person but I think it's best to forgive and forget, e.g. buying a cheaper return when I know I will only use the oneway; or taking a bottle of water from a lounge despite signs saying everything should be consumed inside. No disagreement from me there. I take water from a lounge for my consumption, but to push your example further, I would have a problem with my behavior if I take water from the lounge and then sell it to a passenger who didn't have access to the lounge. Funny things, these personal ethical boundaries. Nice examples, by the way. They helped me clarify where my boundaries were. ",1

You visit a place where everything is expensive, then the solution would be to adjust what you have to make it works to reach your goal. I remember you post what kind of car you have, also what kind of car you want to drive for Oktoberfest. Well, kid, it will be damned expensive to do that in the expensive country. Take a public bus, for example. I don't know your background, but just imagine here. Do you know that many young college students in the US or Canada (the two countries I have lived) do not have much money? Not all their parents are rich. How could they spend time in Europe or even the UK which are very expensive? They take public transit when they are on their holiday in Europe or UK. My point is, that you don't have to be filthy rich to visit Dubi for 12 hours. If there is a will, there will be a way. Good advice, SQLPP. On my first trip to Europe 13 years ago, I had jam and bread for breakfast nearly everyday. Most of my main meals were very simple too. No fancy meals or Michelin stars for me in those days. I travel on public transport. I still do that now!!! Across Europe and most of SE Asia. I hardly ever take the cab. I'm planning my NY trip for Aug. Hotels can be expensive! We've gone down the Priceline route and have found somewhere decent and reasonable. I didn't know DXB can be expensive. Looks like the Sheikh option is getting increasingly attractive. ",0

" Constant change as far as FFPs go! KF changes aside, all fun! IMO, the current PPS requirement is not very high - particularly for those based in SIN. There's been the usual wishful thinking recently on the BA board about a premier/super BA Gold level which would require, for most people, almost exclusive loyalty to BA in order to achieve and in return, you get additional service (such as, in the case of UK PPS members, a proactive PPS coordinator perhaps!). Perhaps SQ will aim for this ? Maybe SQ needs to differentiate PPS depending on where a person is based ? Higher levels for those based in SEA ? ",1
" Indeed the rates are very high. From my calculations, taking an example of SIN-KIX-SIN, SQ is charging slightly above Standard redemption rates (without 15% online discount) plus standard taxes. This is for a solo pax. For 2 pax on a 2-to-go pricing, it makes a little less painful. The full cash price. is $2051. On the miles+cash scheme, one needs to pay 123,284 miles + $794.65. Through the full redemption method, for 2 pax, one will need to pay 90,000 miles (Saver, no online discount) or 180,000 miles (Standard, no online discount) plus approx the same amount as taxes. Good when there're no more Saver seats. The approximate rate of 100 miles = S$1 is indeed fairly high. This is truly a case of ""give, but don't want to give"". ",1

" Being devil's advocate slightly (no offence meant): Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post I did hold out for the few advantages of SQ *G: access to VS lounges; KrisShop-earned miles ; and last but amazingly not least, the affiliation with an airline whose ethos I'd grown to love. I assume you've also factored into your analysis the (much ?) greater availability for SQ awards/upgrades when using KF miles. Not only for the remaining 744 routes but also, if relevant, shorthaul redemptions from SIN. I've not heard of anyone who's willing to pay the ridiculously high 77W (and presumably A380) redemption rates but on the other hand, it seems that redemptions using miles from other programmes are (for the moment at least) unavailable ? Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post If I were to continue my flying days as an Elite Gold, I'd get no SIN SKL access; a segregated checkin counter at SIN; no more Fast Track access at LHR; miles that expire in 3 years but must be used at non-saver redemption levels for the 77W (and likely the A380); and no accelerated security line clearance at SIN (security lines are not a mandated *A privilege, so it should be possible for SQ EGs to get the privilege without extending it to *Gs). Of course apart from the mileage expiration/redemption points, you'd get none of these benefits if you banked with another FFP and made *G there. Unless I'm mistaken, it seems that your main gripes with SQ at the moment (leaving aside the increased redemption rates which don't affect ex-LHR for the moment) boil down to lack of soft touches from SQ UK (i.e. a calendar and invites to events) rather than anything (IMO) serious ? Whilst SQ's ground based service seems to be going down, this seems true of all airlines and I'd be surprised if CX isn't subject to the same intense competitive pressures as SQ. Perhaps a case of better the devil you know rather than switching your main FFP and finding out that things aren't always greener on the other side (or at least don't continue to be in the long term)!

" All the major alliances have strenghs and weaknesses in different regions. I have adopted the strategy of joining the three major alliances so that I accumulate points on most air travel. My rule is to try and gain some points on every transaction. In most cases I can double dip by using my Krisflyer Credit Card. The problem I found is that in many developing countries they is little choice chosing airlines. Take India for instance. Air India is aligned with SQ *A, Kingfisher is aligned with Emirates (Sky Team) and Jet is aligned with QANTAS (one World) and Emirates (Sky Team). On many occassions I have a choice of only one airline for a domestic trip. From India it is easier to take Emirates or BA flight to London rather than *A flight to Frankfurt. The Virgin Atlantic (Aligned *A) flight DEL LHR is problematic from AMD. Whislt *A is better for travelling to Germany. In China *A dominates followed by Sky Team and One World has little presence. In Australia the QANTAS Frequent Flyer program dominates the market with a major supermarket chain/department storce providing on FF mile for every dollar spent over $30 plus a discount of 4 cents per litre on petrol. Double dipping allows FF miles to accumulate on Krisflyer Card, QANTAS points for food stuffs and cheaper petrol The same is the case for hotel chains with different alliances partnering with different chains. Yet again it is not always possible or economical to always stay with preferred alliance groups partner hotel chain. I have decided that the smartest thing is to joint the three major alliances. I am a member of SQ, QANTAS and EMIRATES frequent flyer programs. Although I favour one FF program the others accumulate points and tick over nicely. QANTAS allows low level redemptions for products from their partners such as gift vouchers, wine, move tickets. Moverer they have over 400 partners and points can be earnt when renewing yearly travel insurance etc which unable with other programs. It is also possible to take advantage of credit card situation with some airlines offering free fee credit cards that allow increased FFP when booking. What do other frequent flyers do with respent to alliances. Are you all die hard *A members or do you belong to more than one alliance? ",1

" Allow me to steer off topic a little, My dear moderators Here's my little blog that may be also interesting to some : Just got off a wonderful flight on SQXXX and having read this thread just yesterday. I decided to ask the IFS Mr T. on my flt (quite a senior chap) if he knew or have read the infamous blogsite. He replied as a matter of factly in his nice Singlish slang..oh that one ah? These are stories that we talk about at night stops, some are true and some aren't. Some exaggerated. Take it with a pinch of salt When I asked him about the blogger's background...He said that the management and many senior crew know (or highly suspect) who this EX-Cabin Crew Executive is. I had to ask what the CCE (as they call it) did in the Cabin Crew division. He explained that these were crew who were 'promoted and grounded mostly' after the IFS rank to be trainers and to appraise the flying crew. They also managed the wards/teams. Then a few years back, most of them were given pension or some farewell package (couldn't remember the term he used) and were asked to leave by the company. I was puzzled why and probe further. Well, many of these 'old folks' were sitting around like office managers who lost touch with flying and earning big money, he said. Some were good, but some were just bringing misery to operating crew when they flew with them. He said to cut the story short, many of the bad apples were rid off when majority of the CCE's were asked to leave. Some good ones were retained and are still in the company today. Many of the Ex-CCEs were of course very furious with the sudden move of the company. Some even threatened lawsuit. Others vowed to bad mouth... Some just happily retired Since crew do complain about PITAs pax...I asked IFS Mr T what did most of the crew thought of them (Ex-CCE)..and their absence. He said...GOOD RIDDANCE to those gone.

" Originally posted by Kyo View Post But how was it on the inside? Interesting that you should ask, Kyo! This BTC choice didn't exactly go according to plan. In a rare service lapse (though admirably recovered later on...), I had gone to the restroom while starters were being served in J meal service, and when I returned to my seat, the cabin crew immediately served my main course, not realizing that I had not yet been served my starter. Back to the galley my main course went, and my starter came with profuse apologies. Later, when I was done with my starter, my main course came. And you can guess what happened next. My guess is that the cabin crew dutifully popped my main course back into the oven to keep warm, until my starter was done. When it came to me, and I sliced it open, it was cooked dry on the inside, well done to a brown, cardboard-like consistency, which was a pity, since it looked perfect on the outside the first time it was brought round. At that point, I was a little disappointed, and chewed through a few dry bites before leaving the rest untouched. Later when they came to pick up my main, the stewardess saw my half-eaten main, and asked if there was something a matter with the dish. I mentioned that I found it overcooked (In a polite way, of course...I don't believe in rants...), and she immediately offered to give me another main. ""Yes please, any other main will do!"" They brought me the other steak selection on the regular J menu, which was a perfect, moist, pink and tender on the inside -- which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was happy again and gave them a thumbs up next time they came round to check on me. More on that in an upcoming TR (Yes, Mrs yflyer and I were back in Seoul again last week!). As a preview of the next TR on Seoul, which can probably be considered a sequel to this one, Mrs yflyer's challenge, which she lamented to me was: ""8 meal slots on this trip and 9 places I want to try..."" More on that here :-) So, no opinion on how this BTC dish tasted this time round, although I would give it the benefit of the doubt and order it again, mainly on account of the chimmi-churri sauce, which was quite tasty. But brilliant service recovery on SQ, as always. ",0

" I made a TR about my experience in MalaysianWings when I was a KF newbie, trying to deal with this redemption stuff. At the time it was written, MH's Enrich has yet to offer an online redemption function. . . . In conjunction with KrisFlyer's 10th anniversary, Singapore Airlines offered a discount of 25% for all online redemption made from 1 February 2009 until 15 September 2009, for travel before 1 October 2009, which was an addition of 10% from the usual online redemption discount that KrisFlyer usually offered to its members. On top of that, a discount of 50% for online redemption was also offered, but this offer was date-to-destination specific. As a new KrisFlyer member who only completed a single return journey with the carrier (KUL-SIN-AUH-JED vv), I was thrilled to find out that I was so close from being eligible to redeem a return flight in the lowest redemption category (Region 2  Malaysia, Indonesia & Brunei) under the Economy Saver ticket. Redeeming 11,250 KrisFlyer miles under this ticket (75% x 15,000 miles) will enable me to fly KUL-SIN-DPS vv the furthest. After converting 12,000 Choice Points into 2,000 KrisFlyer miles from my Standard Chartered Bank credit card program, I have 11,514 KrisFlyer miles, sufficient for the intended redemption on the aforementioned ticket category. Recalling all the memories that I have, the most generous offer that Enrich ever came out with in the history of Malaysia Airlines for a return ticket KUL-DPS was 17,500 Enrich miles, which was offered from May to July 2009. That was the moment where I realized that this offer is too good to be left out. So, on 26 May 2009, while playing around with the KrisFlyer website I made a mock booking to DPS during the Hari Raya holiday, a period of which I planned to return back to Malaysia, which coincidentally just short of the dateline of the offer, which is on 30 September 2009. Pairing 22 September 2009 with 24 September 2009 as the date of the inbound and outbound journeys resulted in the availability of the flight, KUL-SIN-DPS-SIN-KUL on the Economy Saver ticket, which was incredible! A further click away, and I was soon have 'accidentally' created a comprehensive itinerary to the enchanting Bali, on an exciting all-Boeing 777-200 aircraft on all 4 sectors. Another click away and I was directed to the payment page, of which one has to settle because award tickets offered by airlines are excluding the airport taxes and applicable surcharges, a practice that is common industry-wide all over the world. For my planned itinerary, I have to pay MYR 439.00, which made up of MYR 51.00 of airport/government taxes and MYR 388.00 of carrier surcharges. After keying in my credit card particulars, I have then completed the simple and extremely pleasant experience doing an online redemption process, something that is impossible for me to do even after years of diligent devotion to Enrich. I was issued with an e-ticket and a confirmed itinerary, which can be modified, right away! The whole process left me grinning from ear to ear throughout the day. I was so excited! I continued playing around with the confirmed itinerary, incorporating 'Muslim Meal' as my preferred meals. The insanely easy to use interface allows travelers to:Select Seat Select Meal Opt for a Singapore Stopover Holiday Book Hotels or Transfer Service Modify Booking Cancel Booking Update Passport and PR Details all in just a few clicks. It is wonders! I don't understand, cracking my head back and forth thinking on why Malaysia Airlines failed do the same with Enrich all these years. WHY? An icing to the whole experience was that my activities were recorded almost on-time, meaning one doesn't have to wait for 3 months to see the movement in the FFP account, unlike a certain 5 star carrier's program. My redemption was recorded right away and it appeared in my statement on 27 May 2009, less than 24 hours after it was made. I was blown away by KrisFlyer's online functions! Definitely the best among all 4 FFPs that I enrolled as a member; better than Emirates' Skywards and KLM's Flying Blue online functions. Malaysia Airline's Enrich you asked? *LOLwhileROTFuntilFaintedFor2days* . . . Fast forward to 14 September 2009, maybe as a karma for belittling Enrich devastatingly on the world wide web in the past couple of months, I was shocked with the news that I can't return to Malaysia for Hari Raya, which in return means that I can't spent the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Hari Raya in Bali on the SQ ticket which was redeemed 4 months earlier. What should I do? Will I lose all the miles since the ticket has been issued? Can I change it to a much later date? What should I do in order to credit back all the 11,250 miles which has been redeemed? This is suck! p/s Should things went according to plan, I will embark on the journey tomorrow (22 September 2009), well, what can I do. ",1

" Originally posted by nickbot View Post My query is this - how do we go about booking award seats and also purchasing the extra miles at the same time? I'm presuming there's an option during the redemption booking to click a tickbox saying ""I'll send in the faxback miles purchase form shortly"" as part of the booking or similar? This is a known chicken and egg problem with KF, but there's a way around it. Write in to KF using the buy miles form, and tell them which award you intend to redeem and then buy the miles first. Then do the booking. Originally posted by nickbot View Post Fingers crossed, we're going to try to redeem miles before any 77W-esque double redemption mileage rules come in for the A380, and take a gamble on securing seats in A380 Business Class on the LHR-SIN-SYD-SIN-LHR route (SIN-SYD-SIN in particular) towards the end of March next year before the A380 schedule is announced. I'm conscious that time is against us, so want to act on this ASAP! Any help would, of course, be very much appreciated You may be out of luck on this one. Firstly, by March, I'm not sure if ALL the LHR routes will be 380'ed. Whilst inventory is not blocked yet, you'll have to guess, and that's a 1 in 3 chance you'll get at least one flight on the 380, and a 1 in 9 (I think) chance you'll get both. The 2nd is that SIN-SYD-SIN is pretty much going to be SQ221/220 (there are 3 a day) - Award inventory in business has been blocked since May of this year - and is blocked for as far out as I can see. By march, I don't think you'll have both or all three of the SYD services 380'ed, as the next deliveries of the planes are going to be dedicated to running a daily to LHR (and you need a minimum of 2 frames, or 3 frames if you want a spare for safety, to run daily LHR) ",1

" I have no experience in redeeming KF miles and would like to know from those of you who have how easy/difficult it is to reedem and actually get seats at the Saver Award levels. I have been changing my patterns of collecting miles dramatically over the last year. Having been a very loyal Aeroplan member with AC for over 10 years, many of those years flying over 200,000 miles a year with them, I decided to distance myself from its program as it has deterioated a lot, just like every other program, except that with AC I don't see a lot of benefits anymore being a top tier member. I actually haven't been even double dipping when flying SQ due to past problems of miles not showing up correctly in the program I wanted them too etc., but also due to the fact that I was getting an additional 25% of miles if flights were on SQ and credited to KF. I see that a lot of you are crediting miles to LH M/M due to the 200% in C and 300% in F miles credit. Something I have been seriously considering and trying to double dip again this year.

" As the contract lounge for many many major airlines, LH, LX, SQ, Virgin etc. the Shanghai Airlines lounge at T2 PVG is a disgrace. Barely any food and only some drinks. One saving grace: you can get hot noodles from a little hole in the wall. When you come up the escalator, it's on your left. Not nearly enough to fill you up but at least it's warm. To be honest the only good thing about that lounge is that you have a place to sit and not have to congregate with everyone before the flight, and the lounge is usually quite close to your boarding gate. P.S. A little birdy told me that when SQ switched to T2, they weren't allowed to have their own lounge because of the MU deal falling through. Don't know how true that is but either way, very disappointing. ",0

" A bit of a surprise when I checked in for my KIX-SIN flight on SQ. While SQ uses Star Alliance partner ANA's Lounge in Narita (And Haneda as well, I believe), at KIX, the designated SQ lounge is the JAL Sakura Lounge.

For me, this was a pleasant surprise, because while the ANA lounges are good, I have always liked the JAL lounges in NRT and HND, both for the ambience as well as the catering -- I love JAL's signature beef curry which they serve in their lounges.

I get miles for 2 Cents and use them if I get more than 2 Cents out of them. The changes are fair and balanced and in the bigger picture the total cost for my award travel will be more or less the same.

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post Well I never knew that!. Maybe an opportunity to burn some of the 400K LifeMiles I am sat on and am scared of using as I cannot spend another two hours of my life just to cancel a flight. I would reiterate advice you have probably heard or read before : only use your LM is you are absolutely certain you will be travelling. Or that your travel plans won't change. I experienced the infamous LM cancellation experience a couple of weeks ago. Spent 6 hours over 5 days with multiple people in various 'departments' over the phone and email and they couldn't cancel the ticket. Back in March I had an involuntary schedule change by TG which resulted in the ticket being reissued from Taca (202) to Avianca (134) ticket stock, which in itself was another ordeal and another story for another thread, and apparently this meant the LM call centre couldn't access the ticket to complete the cancellation. And in the meantime inventory on the new flights I wanted to book (to avoid a 14 hour stop in BKK that TG had left me with, amongst other reasons) had disappeared... so I had to rescind my cancellation request and make sure that they DO NOT cancel my existing itinerary. So far they've not touched it and the ticket looks normal, but I'll only be able to relax once I'm able to check in and make it onboard the flipping plane.... It has made me rather wary of using them for anything other than very, very simple point to point itineraries with no connections or flights for imminent travel as I really will not be able to hack spending 3 hours on the phone with them trying to reissue or cancel a ticket.

Even though I'm no fan of the changes to PPS, I fail to see your point here. How is this any different than the old ""qualify via sectors"" system that we had previously? If you accumulated 50 sectors in the 12-month qualification period before, it's not like SQ gave you two years of PPS eligibility...they gave you one year, and at the requal time your qualifying sector count reset to 0. Yes, the currency has changed, and for most the bar has been set higher than it was previously, but I don't see any fundamental unfairness compared to the system before.

 Thanks for the welcome. I can't believe how long it took for a certain someone to persuade me to come over to SQT. Does anyone know how SQ calculates PPSV on fares involving more than one airline?

" Living up to its reputation as a *A hub, our dear Suvarnabhumi has received a new addition to its lounge lineup. The TK lounge, which opened earlier this year, is conveniently located near D8 — well within reach of SQ loyalists. Being a standard *G lounge, regular admission rules apply. PP is also accepted here. It's right across the JL Sakura and around the corner from the BR lounge. An A330 model sits stop the front desk where you're greeted by the friendly lounge staff. Non-TK boarding passes are scanned and photocopied here. First impressions: it's a bright and pleasant-looking place with colour tones that are easy on the eye. Some comfy swivel armchairs by the windows give you the choice of looking out towards the bustling arrival pickup area or sit face-to-face with a companion. They're also the closest thing this place has to a dining-friendly seats. There were three locally-inspired hot items on offer, in addition to rice and congee. A modest selection of finger food, dessert and salad sits on the other side of the counter. The most unique feature of this lounge: the Turkish pizza station, which opens around 11am. It comes with a decent variety of accompaniments and sauces. ",0

Before the change to SQ SIN-KUL flights, FC used to be one of the easiest FFPs in the world to get top tier status! As for BAEC, it depends on your circumstances, e.g. * 25,000 BA miles for an upgrade from WT+ to CW from LHR to anywhere in North America is a pretty good deal (plus availability tends to be quite good) particularly when you earn most of it back (even more so with the silver/gold 25/50% bonus). * For those based in the UK, BA's tie up with Tesco (and the Amex 241 vouchers) mean that with some planning it's enough to get enough miles for a trip for two each year to somewhere nice, e.g. I've done NRT (J) and NRT (F) in past years and have CPT (F) coming up next month. Some people in the past earnt enough to do that each year without even stepping foot on a plane! * Eurocheating and (before they were abolished) the BAH-DOH tier point runs etc means that it's pretty easy to get top tier status on BAEC. Of course none of this comes close to just how generous BD are with their programme... ",0

" Frequent flyer programs are costing money - that is a matter of fact. SQ did a smart move when they were asking for money instead of miles to enter the PPS Club - at the end of the day it is not how often you show up at the airport but how much money they make with you... At the same time, SQ took the liberty to cut cost per member by eliminating perks and basically increasing award prices by 100% for the 77W and the A380. I am afraid they were a bit over-ambitious here: Not allowing F check-in for QPP anymore was wrong, raising the prices for award flights as well. There are no perks when flying in J at all - other then you might get your meal choice. Comparing my perks as a SEN on LH to PPS on SQ, LH wins hands down. Generous 300% reward miles in F, booking guarantees in C, guaranteed awards at just 150%. SQ has faced a lot of criticism and while many have not much choice but flying SQ, they will launch some ""modifications"" to their program soon.

You should be able to fly BNE-SIN-BKK-NRT-LAX-LHR-SIN-BNE all with SQ flight numbers and therefore earning 22.5 PPS sectors.

If we send many individual letters, the unhappiness will seem to be more widespread and less organized. Sending a petition-like collective letter might even increase their defense barrier. I hope I am making sense. JMO. While I understand the strength of individual letters, I also see the strength of sending a single letter addressed to an actual person (not 'Dear Sir/Madam'), with a credible/verifiable list of signees. That can certainly have a very strong impact as well. However, it is obvious we should not make it sound like a ""petition""-type deal where we just did something like collect signatures at the SKL. Of course sending individual complaint letters is still encouraged! ",1

It says I have 21,560 miles, but says Earned: 828 Elite Miles and Requires is 24,172 miles by 31 January 2017. Well, some of you know I am flying SQ this December/January to India and that I am earning more miles. Checking my past trip history, it says I have done a trip on UA to Las Vegas back in January (which I did do and put me and my mom to earn miles) but it doesn't show my June 2015 trip which I took SQ15 and SQ16. I am a little bit confused. Have my miles expired or something or am I going to earn Silver by the end of this trip and my miles are retained? (Please note, it also applies to my mother as well). If this be the case, I will think of other ways to earn KF miles other than just flying Star Alliance carriers. Thanks. ",1

" Originally posted by quik! View Post In a slightly positive news, I managed to redeem KUL-SIN-LHR return ticket redemption on Savers (outbound - 22 Dec) and Standard (inbound - 3 Jan). My outbound leg was waitlisted, and confirmed on the Standard. Tax & surcharge charges really cheap at RM1388. Total miles burnt is approx 89,000. Actually not even sure if this is good news...I would love to have redeemed under Savers but I figure that if I waitlisted for both legs in Savers, I wouldn't stand a chance to ticket the booking before my deadline. Sorry to sound like a sour puss, but what incentive would SQ have to approve your waitlist, if you seem not to mind getting a standard award? Also, how are your miles deducted in this case? Do they credit back the extra miles should a saver seat open up (under what premise, we don't know) ",1

" Hi Guys here is the situation. i currently have around 200k SQ miles and another 70k in amex i can transfer across if needed, and am SQ gold for last few years. i would like to travel from the UK (lhr/man, bhx at a push) to Australia. We will be 2 adults, one child (3yrs) and one infant (4mths). We need to go to Sydney for 2-3 days , then onto adelaide for 7-8 days. (Ideally open jaw) Here is where it gets interesting. My company willl cover the costs for ME to go, and i intend using miles to pay for my wife, then pay ourselves for the children. However, the embargo on LHR flights (all 777/380) means i cant afford to use miles for Mrs D. However, i have noticed that a paid companion fare on VS is good value at 200k miles though, but child fare is a lot. What i am wondering, is if it better to travel using *A miles (eg TG) as it is only 150K miles, should i use these, and top up to cover child fare aswell (300k total), or is availability in July likely to be nil. We do need to stopover each way (need a one night break minimum travllling with 2 kids), but not bothered where at all. so the question is, what would YOU do ???? Once this burn is out of the way, i am transferring to M&M from KF as i am in europe and it is simply a lot easier... ",1

" Originally posted by SuperJonJon View Post Firstly, Welcome to SQTalk, Vtac82! Krisflyer miles and Elite miles are actually two seperate things. Elite miles are earned only thru flying but Krisflyer miles can be earned through credit cards, hotel stays, etc. I am guessing that you have flown about 26,936 miles or slightly more. When you hit 25K or slightly above, you achieved KF Silver in May thus the counter has reset. You have flown 1,936 miles since achieving Silver and would require another 23,064 miles to get Gold. I hope that I am wrong and you get your KF Gold this sunday. Thanks SuperJonJon. My miles are strictly Elite Miles. I have flown like crazy for the past few months due to work. Also, I get to fly A380 NRT-SIN, so I'm really excited about that! ",1

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post Sigh. And CX for Emeralds? Guess you meant Diamonds, for thats what CX calls their own in that OW tier. Curiosity got the better of me and I spent some time/logged in on this forum after dog years today (after ending up reading the related thread on FT, a divergence from the massively useful credit cards thread there that I try to follow). So what does CX do: - Upgrades on birthdays (not just cakes..), Club milestones, overbooking scenarios - Seat guarantees in reasonable biz & coach fareclasses - Opens up award inventory for redemption (in coach, biz and first) - note..'opens up'..not 'priority access' - Respond to feedback with actual human (non-form) replies - Rush me through immigration/security etc when needed (seen this at CMB, SIN, HKG, SFO, JFK) - Gives me lounge access when travelling any metal. Gives me FCL lounge access when travelling oneworld metal My favorite story, and this when I wasn't DM, just a 'fresh' CX GO. I was based in HKG, and (the then) girfriend (now wife) was returning to SIN from DXB on an SQ redeye flight landing a friday morning. Original plan had been for her to catch up with some work before coming to HKG for the weekend and she was booked on the evening CX flight to HKG (separate ticket, and she had no status with CX). Plans changed and she decided to skip work that day and head to HKG right after landing. As luck would have - all flights to HKG were booked rock solid - CX & SQ. Meanwhile, I had been discussing an issue with Cathay Marco Polo Club that week, where they'd messed up a bit (dont recall exactly what, but must've been minor enough that I dont recall what had been) and they'd been profusely apologetic with a 'If there's anything reasonable that we could do to make up, we would'. This was that thursday evening. A bulb lit up somewhere and I told them: 'My girlfriend lands tomorrow morning from DXB on SQ and is booked on 716 to HKG. Flights are booked out solid, but if you can get her to HKG in time for us to enjoy lunch together, I'll call it even.' Guess what - there's a CX rep waiting at her arrival gate in T2, to escort her to T1 (and she had no clue, since i'd asked them after she'd boarded), with a 'Ma'am the flights are booked out solid, but we've put you as the highest priority for standby'. Sure enough, we had an excellent dimsum lunch that friday, and a love affair began - with Cathay that is (ours had been on for a while). I moved to SIN, got married, and both of us are happy flying CX to North America/ Europe. Work doesn't require SEA travel, so i stick to non-SQ options (on account of some nasty experiences with SQ). CX treats me well (as I am sure SQ treats its PPS members) - just that that gold dust that I had heard of, but never seen, with SQ, does come around fairly often with CX. ",1

Are there any thoughts on if this might be possible and how to try to make it happen? Many thanks in advance. ",0
" Originally posted by Desert Traveller View Post I did, kinda, but not with LH. I used the KVS tool to check KF availability for Saver and Standard. And then entered the ticket and flight details on the M&M online upgrade site, which checks availability as well. Upgrade was confirmed right away. No hassle at all. Within minutes, the KF site showed my booking split in two with a separate PNR number for the upgraded leg. Seats and meals are selectable online. For once, *A does seem to provide seamless integration. Only downside, the M&M mini site is not very user friendly when it comes to selecting airports and filling out some other fields. That might be a browser issue though. For fun, I tried to upgrade SQ25, but the mini site came back with 'contact your M&M team'. So you booked the ticket via SQ and then upgraded via LH? ",1
" Ah but my point was partly that with some hotels (such as the Mercure), when I use the same booking method (i.e., my corporate travel agent), I've tended to have far fewer problems crediting to European FFPs (e.g., Flying Blue or M&M) than when I attempt to credit to KrisFlyer or Asia Miles.

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post I was in T2 SKL F earlier this year speaking to a couple of rather wealthy Indian gentlemen who were going from India to the US regularly in First along with various other business associates. They said they had been flying SQ all the time but LH were now US$ 6000 cheaper so they had switched all their future flights over to them. As well as being $6000 cheaper, they mentioned the FCT in FRA compared to the SKL in T2 and also HON status compared to PPS. Not much of a comparison really...... HON Circle is a lot easier to obtain than Solitaire and is a ways better program: Qualification for HON Circle is 600.000 miles in two years whereby F earns 325% if you are already *S or *G with LH, so you have to fly only 185.000 distance miles in F to make it and J earns 225%, hence 267.000 distance miles are needed. SIN-FRA-SIN is 12.774 distance miles, 15 F tickets or 21 J tickets will be sufficient. Let's say ticket prices are 16.000 SGD in F and 8.000 SGD in J, total ""cost"" would be 240.000 SGD for flying in F and 168.000 SGD for flying in J. Status is awarded for at least two years. You get: - Booking guarantee for booking classes C and D till 24 hours before departure (equals Z and C on SQ). LH would actually overbook J and then deal with it at the airport (upgrade/downgrade/bump other pax) - Access to Saver Awards in J as long as there are seats available for sales (on SQ you have to redeem a Full Award). LH will try to do the same in F (but this is not a published benefit) - 50% off for companion awards in all classes of service. - 3 international one-class-upgrades upon qualification (nothing on SQ) - You have 600.000 miles to spend upon qualification (KF would have only earned you 335.000 miles flying in F while redemptions on SQ are same level or more expensive) What can SQ do? - Introduce booking guarantee for undiscounted Z fares for Solitaire - Lower the treshold to become Solitaire - Raise the threshold to stay Solitaire - Introduce upgrades vouchers for any 50.000 SGD PPS Value flown - Have a 24/7 hotline in Singapore (cannot believe they still close at 6pm every day!) - Give Solitaire members access to saver awards/upgrades as long as booking class D is available ",1

 It depends on how you use it I guess. Drop down and keep dropping then it is soft landing. Use it to rest a year before requalifying for Solitaire and it is a free ride (no need to get 250k PPS Value all over again). ,1

" Rather than be annoyed with Krisflyer, I would start exploring other FFPs. For example, if you can fly 40k miles in a short period of time, you can gain OZ Diamond (Star Gold) which is valid for almost 4 years. You will then receive the same recognition as Krisflyer Elite Gold, without flying 50k every year and you will not have to worry about maintaining any Star Gold status during that time. Other airlines like BMI (though who knows what will happen in the future after the LH takeover) have a much more generous reward ticket chart than SQ. US Airways has the big benefit that they do not charge the Fuel Surcharge on reward tickets, which makes the taxes on a long-haul reward ticket only a fraction of other airlines that charge the YQ. And so on. If you fly that much, there are a lot of different possibilities with other airlines. Make the most of it ",1

Baby Meal (BBML) Suitable for infants less than 1 year old, this meal consists of 3 jars of assorted baby food - main course, vegetables and dessert. Post-Weaning Meal (PWMLM) Suitable for infants between 1 and 2 years old, this meal is more substantial than a Baby Meal. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest.

" I am in the HCMC Star Alliance lounge now and can advise that the facilities have been drastically cut back. At the old terminal Star Alliance airlines shared with other airlines in a SASCO lounge and it was a bit tight but they had a good range of food and beverage including about 4 hot choices and a proper Vietnamese noodle soup. The bar was self serve and quite extensive. When the new terminal opened Star Alliance was allocated one of the four (I believe) lounges which are all managed by SASCO. Much more space with less customers and a wide choice of F & B. Up to 8 hot dishes plus proper vietnamese soup and an extensive bar. I have not been in the lounge for about 6 weeks and the facilities have now been cut back enormously. Only one hot dish, one cold cut instead of 5 or 6, no baquettes only plastic sliced bread and instant noodles with water not a soup stock.

The RGL and ATP route applies, as you have already alluded to, to the targeted overseas business population that the government (rightly or wrongly being a separate issue) hoped to attract. It doesn't apply to OYK, for obvious reasons. So your spiel about ""please PAP members and the public"" is completely misguided, and once again short on substantive facts. If you feel salty that you didn't get to enter Singapore just like these C suites, that's a separate issue and doesn't give you free rein to slap facts around. There is no way he can ""go under the same blanket approval"" because he is obviously not a foreigner. I have a rather poor impression of OYK and his ilk but you were (and still are) just cooking up baseless smoke. If you can't be bothered to read the legislative provisions (or even the websites) for each of the various potential entry routes into Singapore, then that's fine, but please don't puff out unhelpful misinformation and then when called out for your lack of veracity, come up with a Hail Mary and say ""go check with the government"". I call that plain irresponsibility. ",1

Whilst the questions below are definitely of an internal matter, I would encourage Management to consider the following: a) Who proposed and tabled the board paper for the system upgrade? Similar to Apple Inc, has anything been done at SIA to hold those accountable for this ""costly"" damage? Other than financial loss, such as ""forgone online-bookings"", there would also be a non-quantifiable reputation loss? b) Did your in-house IT team perform an extensive User Acceptance Test (UAT) in 2011? This is a ""Basic 101"" requirement, and hopefully was one of the ""many"" test steps prior to the vendor being paid for services ""delivered""? c) Did the SIA IT Internal Audit team raise deficiencies and recommend action plans for remedial action? d) The vendor clearly failed to meet SIA's standards and requirements. It likely failed to deliver, per its ""Scope of Work"". Has the vendor been penalized? Have actions been taken? e) Post-2011, there have been numerous ""upgrades"" to your website, of which SIA had been criticized at least once, for a 48 hour downtime.

" I actually did a mileage run from SYD-HKG and back with SQ, which gave me way more elite miles than needed. More fun than anything!

Tell them you have travel plans in SEP/OCT and would really like to reach Gold before the membership year expires. They also may be able to extend your membership year a couple months, so you can hit Gold when you next travel. This is all at their discretion, so there's no guarantee, but given it's only 232 miles it is certainly not impossible. If this doesn't work, then do the mileage run depending how much you value your miles and status. Also consider how many actual KrisFlyer miles you are earning for the mileage run, as they can obviously be used later. Also bear in mind that when you travel on a Star Alliance carrier, it can take up to 6 weeks for the miles to hit your account (although it's almost always far less than this). ",1

" Originally posted by LionCity View Post Although I like to fly SQ, it is not blind faith. After 17 years faithfully with the airline and spending more than 1 Million, it is not the way to treat you. Best thing is to give SQ a boot by not flying with them as there are other airlines that already close to SQ's service and hardware. For example Jet Airways, CX and the Mid-East airlines are getting very good and you pay less. Vote with your pocket. Anyway, most of the time SQ wasted their money on some not very successful investments overseas rather than enhancing the experiences. It is ""very heng"" that the present board is not buying into China Eastern Airlines. But, I am sure there are most people with more years than I have and spent way more money than I have personally. I was from a breed of people that worked for establishments when SQ was a Govt owned company or stat board, and had to support our national airline. And we always supported them until this and now. I have never flown any other airline unless I really really had to in a destination that SQ didnt fly to. For example, when we made our trips, for instance to Paris from New York, we had to fly to AMS or Frankfurt and take a shuttle to Paris. We didnt go direct NY-CDG. And that was the way it was for people working in govt organizations. Our directive was to support our national airline. So much for that ! Since I left the service, this may have changed and perhaps they no longer need to support SQ. Investments ? Even Govt organizations make ""not so good"" investments, after all they take risks, whether admittedly or not, ""calculated"" risks. ",1
" Just to add about the Japanese Ducken.... I would like to take you on a magical trip of the pictured Japanese teriyaki plate. Please, no one, find any offense in my comments as there is none intended. Also pictured on the plate are carrot, sato-imo, sh!take mushrooms, fried tofu the combination of which is often called ""nimono"". All those and many other ingredients when put together and stewed(or boiled)with a shoyu based sweet sauce (aka teriyaki) are called nimono. This kind of dish is a regular on most tables in Japan and is often found during a kaiseki meal when it appears as a Kobachi in a small serving dish. This kind of dish can also be found in bento boxes. Another favorite of mine is dried/reconstituted daikon radish and carrot in a julienne style which is also served with the same sauce above. With regards to the sauce, each regions sauce(teriyaki) will taste different. All use the same basic ingredients of Shoyu, sugar, mirin, sake and some fish stock(but not always) but in various amounts. The teiyaki sauce where I live is noted for it's strong taste(Kyushu) where as somewhere like Kyoto will have a very light taste. There is also a variance between households. Japanese food is generally not served on one plate, but in many dishes. So if the above were to be served in Japan one would no doubt see the rice, nimono, chicken served seperately and no doubt including a bowl of soup! This would follow the tradition that a standard meal comprises three okazu and is termed ichijū-sansai (一汁三菜; ""one soup, three sides""). I hope this was informative in some way....... ",0

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post Rather amusing to see SQ open up what is supposed to be one of their flagship overseas lounges that recently had an expensive refurb to PR pax (and open it up earlier than before) while pax who could be spending a huge amount with them annually, but 'only' in Y, get booted into a sub standard lounge at their own hub. While KF Gold is nice in that it gets you Star Gold privileges with Star Alliance carriers, I've always felt that SQ have missed out on a big opportunity to increase loyalty (and revenue) by targeting frequent travellers in Y. I think SQ have done reasonably well to maintain loyalty of F and J pax. It is essential for a premium airline like SQ to pamper guests in F and J, and they need to maintain or even increase the exclusivity and benefits of PPS membership to retain (regain?) the loyalty of this segment. But they have long neglected the frequent travellers in Y sandwiched between the top end and the budget conscious, giving them 2nd class frequent flyer benefits, for example, the mediocre KF Gold lounge in Changi, and the fact that if you travel Y, even if you do 150-200K miles a year (Which I do on a fairly regular basis), you will not hit PPS. For that reason, in recent years, as soon as I hit 50K miles and qualify for KF Gold, I essentially stop flying SQ and move across to Oneworld, who treat their economy class frequent flyers much better. That effectively means my annual spend on SQ is between 25 to 30% per year of what it used to be. I am probably not alone in that segment, and with recent corporate cutbacks, I am sure more business travellers are having to travel Y for shorter journeys, or consider alternative airlines with cheaper J options. If I were SQ management, I would refine their loyalty strategy to reflect this, and be more inclusive when it comes to their Y frequent flyers. It's not going to restore my business to SQ to earlier levels, though. I've grown to like Oneworld carriers like QF, BA, JL and CX so much that even if and when I start flying J regularly, I will probably continue flying Oneworld, and not just SQ. ",0

" Originally posted by LOWJHG View Post well, you can try MILES & MORE since your flights are mostly to europe regions. btw one flight from SIN to FRA in first class (round trip) can already propel you to FREQUENT TRAVELLER (*A status) status. also try to get the HON CIRCLE status to get exclusive access into the FIRST class terminal in FRA My interpretation from the first post by QPP flyer 2 is that he/she wants an alternative where to park the miles when flying premium class on SQ (being QPP as mentioned), which he/she credited to Kris Flyer now. Yes, LH M&M can be an alternative to where the miles are credited. (Remember the benefit of the double dipping when flying SQ premium class.) Still, the highest elite level to boot is SENATOR. HON Circle is a different ball to play with. HON CIRCLE status miles requirement is strictly earned only on LH and its affiliates airlines, such as LX, Air One etc. Thus, with QPP flyer 2 flies SQ metal from SIN to Europe, there is no way he/she would gain HON CIRCLE. Furthermore, FIRST CLASS TERMINAL at FRA is only for FC pax and HON Circle who depart on LH. Thus, flying SQ from FRA, even though someone has HON Circle status, will not gain access for the use of FCT. I hope I clarify somewhat misleading post. Welcome to SQTalk, QPP flyer 2 and LOWJHG! ",1

" I am on an upgradable ticket for SIN-PVG-SIN early next month. It will be my first time in Biz. I would like to upgrade to a Biz saver award for the return flight. The primary reason behind this is that the flight lands later (11pmish) and I might have a somewhat early start to the next day and would like to be refreshed. The upgrade page however, says that the Biz Saver and Standard options are not available and that only the Biz Full option is. I'm obviously not going to spend 85k miles on that. However, when I go to the normal points booking page (i.e.: For new flights, not for upgrades), it states that the Saver's option is on waitlist. On the other hand, the SIN-PVG leg has a Biz saver option open. If I can't get the first leg, I'd like to do this instead; just for the sake of flying business. So my queries are really these: 1) Is there any way I can not use the Biz Full option and get placed on the Biz Saver waiting list for PVG-SIN instead? 2) How are the lounge facilities at PVG for SQ J ticket holders?

" What are the acronyms you used ? IIRC, TPP ? The others I can more or less figure out. But, the fact that you have to achieve PPSV 25k in 12mths, means you have to actually take the trouble to calculate how much you have and make sure u just make 25k and not go over my too much, and defer trips to the following year. The burden of qualifying becomes the loyal passengers. This does not make sense at all, where the loyal passenger is doing all the work. Sounds like the COE, where we pay for a piece of paper entitling someone to own a car, and the tearing coupon for parking, where it becomes your responsibility to make sure you pay for parking, if not get fined, that is what SQ has turned into !! SQ also instituted a fine system, for SPPS in redeeming certificates. For example, you make a mistake in your online booking and need to change, it is either USD25 or loose 2500 miles for a mistake done online. SPPS used to have fees waived for everything. Not anymore.

Hope you have better experience next time. The customer service bar is so low with most US airlines (exception is Alaska Air, btw, which happens to be partners with CX) that three calls and 15 minutes to take care of simple task didn't even faze me. The nightmare scenario is the ""we can't help you"" preceded by something like this: 1. Busy signal on first five calls. 2. Ring on next call. Byzantine voicemail options tree not helped by the ""please listen carefully, our voicemail options have changed"" preamble. Yes, they changed all right--during the Clinton administration. 3. Eventually press the right combination of keys after 3 or 4 more calls only to hear the ""all reps are currently busy. Thank you for your patience"" refrain. I'm not particularly patient, but what the hell else am I going to do? 4. This is followed by several renditions of the ""your call is very important to us"" and ""all reps are still busy"" tape loop. If I hadn't heard the first part a few thousand times from every corporate boiler room from the phone company to the garbage hauler--none of whom really give a rat's ass about MY call--it might even leave me feeling all warm and fuzzy. As it is, I roll my eyes wearily and hang on for the long haul. (Think of it as packed full nonstop C class from EWR-SIN in a middle seat between a really fat guy and somebody in F's nanny holding a constantly screaming infant.) 5. Every so often, as if intended to break up the monotony, a different recorded voice advises that ""due to unusually high call volume"" it may take a while for someone to actually answer the phone. When you've heard this with the same airline over a period of months, with nothing special going on on the calendar, you know it's pure bullshit intended to outwit the gullible. My brain screams, ""Hey, how about hiring a few more minimum wage slaves with no training so you can at least handle your average call volume, assholes?"" But I digress. 6. Bad music (often an airline theme or some calming version of a pathetic pop standard) seemingly recorded in 1975 given all the skips, pops and static, plays between the taped excuses. 7. Forty-five minutes after the first call, real-life person picks up only to advise solemnly that I've foolishly called the wrong 800 number, and ""No, sorry sir, I'm unable to transfer you. . ."" Homicidal thoughts well up until the medication takes hold much later. ""Thank you for flying Sky High Airlines. We appreciate your business."" --mcz ",0

Hope that LGA/JFK/EWR is considered the same station as you need to break the journey with surface sector as there is no *A flight between YYZ-JFK. You have to fly into LGA/EWR.

We are in 2c and 2 D from memory will have to check again. If it is not busy on the flight I will ask the FA if my wife and I can have our suite setup as a double bed and see if it is possible just for landing and take odd that we can be near a window seat.

" Originally posted by matt_will_fix_it View Post While you did get Elite Gold, I think you were lucky that they bent the rules for you. Its not the rule of thumb. The official rule is if your account is 12+ months old with no status you need 25,000 to reach silver then another 50,000 to reach gold. Many people I know have had to get 75,000 miles to get Elite Gold. Would you check again about this please... I never had any first hand experience for this ES and EG status. But one of my cousins reached 25K, and got ES. Thus reset to zero. Then earned another 25K.. and kaboom... an EG status. Perhaps in the case of your friends, the time span in getting 25K and the next 25K is almost 12 months. Been trying to create an example, but at the moment no time to do so. But please check with your friends, by the requalification period of when they got ES perhaps they did not reach 50K total. Thus, only still ES. Then suddenly they flew more, and got 50K. And this made them thinking that they need 75K. Let me rephrase it. January 2006 they had 25K. ES... They travel again and in December 2006, they traveled 20K. Thus short from 50K. February 2007 had 5K additional.... Then June 2007 flew 25K. And yes, it's EG. So it felt like your friend needed 75K. But actually, it was not. After hitting the ES 25K, if that 5K in Feb 2007 was flown in January, your friend had accumulated 50K, thus EG. And now the computer sees that your friend had 20K in Dec 2006, and 5K in Feb 27. In addition, June 2007 had 25K for total 50K. Therefore, EG. I may be wrong, but hope you got the idea how it works. Happy flying! ",1

" Originally posted by MSPeconomist View Post Is there a *A program that allows family pooling of miles that both tickets could be credited to? Then you'd have twice as many miles in a single account, which could be easier to use for award tickets or upgrades with miles. The OZ program allows pooling between family members. Basically, how it works is that each individual has their normal OZ account and accrues miles for themselves just like KF. But once you establish yourself into a family group (not sure what the exact criteria is but it would probably be the same last name) then you can see all of the individual mileage account balances of the members and you can redeem awards from the family pool. So the concept is, accrue individually but redeem as a family. Thats how the family thing on OZ works. ",1

SQ's response contains no apology of any kind from VS about the rude treatment I had received, and the above quoted language doesn't spell out explicitly that SQ passengers on a SQ flight are allowed access.

I think it's worth investigating further, I'm going through SFO next month to ICN. I believe this is (or at least was pre-LHR overhaul) the v-flyer lot's favourite VS CH. It's not really in a ""different"" terminal, exactly. When you check in (whatever aisle it is (4? 6?), instead of heading towards the G wing, do a 180? and head in the other direction to the A wing. Before you reach security, you'll see a little corridor on the left side, take the elevator up (4th floor), and it'll be there. (I think there may be a JAL lounge there as well but can't remember). BTW I think the Clubhouse only opens some 3 hours prior to its only departure at 1620. ",0

Actually none (if not then most do not) require you to hold a credit card to join. Most FFPs are tied up with certain CC's enabling you to earn miles when you spend (as an additional way to earn miles). Joining a FFP will greatly depend on where you are located, and which routes / airline you will mostly be flying. From there, you can then consider which FFP will be most beneficial to you, taking into consideration alliances (Star Alliance, One World, Skyteam, etc.), earning potential, etc. ",1

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post Separated this into a thread of it's own to save it getting lost in the main one. I have to say the way SQ have or are handling this is farcical. First of all I was told the same as Cruiser Elite, that Changi (the airport itself) had removed the screens, which never made any sense from the off. The second and third times I was in there the reply was it was 'a management decision'. However, having filled in a complaint form on the original visit I finally got an official reply a few weeks ago and this is some of it: OK, that's pretty clear but you really do have to ask why they were told to tell us lies about it initially ?!. If they are doing this new personalised service, and they clearly are from my recent experience, why not just tell us this instead of telling outright lies that 'Changi have taken them down' On the subject itself, I remain bemused by the decision and think its wrong. It's all well and good saying they will remember where everyone in there is flying, and that's been easy last few visits when it's been dead. But that's a tricky one to keep up when it's full during the large early and late banks of departures each day. The closest screens now are back in the corridor just after the SKL J lounge, which is quite a trek from TPR and means you either leave your belongings there and walk there and back or pack everything up while you walk there and back. I think the fact they initially blatantly lied bout the reason they had gone shows some people involved in this are not convinced by it either... IIRC, OZ and LH offer this service AND they have boards in their F lounges! ",0

" This is answered in the KF Programme Guide here.  Subject to individual airlines flight schedule changes.  You can make your booking only for round-trip travel on scheduled flights operated by Star Alliance carriers. All reservations must be confirmed before ticketing. Waitlisting is not permitted except on Singapore Airlines operated sectors only. If your itinerary includes bookings in different classes of service, the award level corresponding to the highest class will apply for the whole award ticket. Travel is subject to the blackout dates and capacity control of individual Star Alliance carriers.  Your Star Alliance Award itinerary can include a complimentary en route stopover in addition to the turnaround point. No stopovers are allowed for purely domestic travel or if your itinerary includes only European cities. You may not stopover in the country where you commenced your travel. For travel to or from Central America, no stopover is permitted in Continental USA. You are allowed a maximum of six travel segments in your itinerary.  You may include transits in your itinerary for flight connections. However, you cannot use your original departure point to transfer to a final destination on the return leg.  You can purchase additional stopovers for 10,000 KrisFlyer miles regardless of your class of travel.  For more flexible travel, you can include an open-jaw at either the origin or the destination (e.g. fly Singapore to San Francisco, then LA to Singapore, or fly Seoul to Singapore, then take a return leg to Tokyo). En route open-jaws are not permitted for Star Alliance Awards. Open-jaws are permitted across different award zones but the higher award level will apply.  Side trips are not permitted. A separate award ticket is required for a side trip.  Backtracking is not permitted. Travel must be made via the most direct route.  You can only make changes to the destination or carrier on an issued ticket if travel has not commenced. Such changes will require re-issuance of tickets at a service charge. Please refer to krisflyer.com for the relevant fee.  Itineraries must include at least one Star Alliance airline partner (excluding Singapore Airlines). ",1

I bet on 2008 for suites to become available only for unrestricted awards and for other seats to return to normal availability. In 2008, SQ will take delivery of nine 777-300ERs and five WhaleJets. That will do wonders for the current capacity shortfall caused by the WhaleJet delays. It HAS to return to normal. There will come a time when they're all delivered, and when you can't HELP but bump into the 77W or 380 if you want to go somewhere nice.

" Originally posted by bluepanda View Post Thanks for your reply. You are just doing a variant of C. So you paid 68k miles for SIN-CDG. Question is did you pay ~27k for PER-SIN (in which case it's just a separate booking), or did you just top up ~4k miles? So still need to choose. Would you do A or B if you were to start again? For me B/C. I have done both. C may need a little argument. A is tricky. Like you said, you are already occupying those seats so it will be waitlist for sure and need to follow up with multiple calls. Even omitting a sector like I tried to omit CGK-SIN out of a CGK-SIN-CDG ticket still requires the system to find a fresh new SIN-CDG ticket. Splitting and omitting are not what the system finds. The system basically tries to find a new itinerary first and then assess the difference between new and old. B sounds safest to me. Once you had issued online, when you call, you have a case to tell them, i want to make such and such change but the system is not allowing it. Change of dates should be something that the system allows. C's kind of change is a bit stretching it, because it's not just a change of date but a change of route as well. But I always got my way. Mingster didnt pay the USD 100 stop over charge on the one-way flight. this is luck. I have had 2 such cases, but more often than not, agents are aware that the USD 100 needs to be charged. I think this is a manual charge and not something that the system will automatically price in upon reissuing. So good luck. You don't have to prompt them, just wait till they tell you how much to pay extra and how much miles to top up. ",1

Mr. Megatop skulks around duty free half the time we're in the airport anyway, and he up and disappears for the other half. So this would be little different. To be honest, if there is an airport in the world that has so many decent options that lounge access is somewhat irrlevant it's Changi. I tend to think this must be SQ's thinking such is the lack of thought in their lounges, especially the abandoned SKL's in T2. In T2 I don't even bother with the SKL nowadays.

" Originally posted by Lobster View Post There has always been one huge fundamental flaw in the change. They have been promoting it as making PPS more exclusive and giving a better service to the members who still qualify. And I believe that most people would accept this if they could see the improvements. However along side this management spin they have drastically cut the benefits members receive. Your average PPS member I'm sure is highly educated and really will not be fooled by such a simply ploy. They can easily see it is a straight forward cost cutting measure. They're cost cutting everywhere and can barely disguise it... take their alleged ""enhancements"" of the F class product. While the seat became wider and the screen bigger, food portions (esp. caviar) are smaller now + no special touches (such as the F logo on serviettes etc.), Dom has disappeared at SKL F (and I bet will not return) and there was no separate wine list anymore on a recent LAX-TPE flight. Looked a bit cheap to have the wine list at the back of the food menu. Wouldn't surprise me if Krug and Caviar will disappear as well in the near future... maybe when they introduce their new ""First suite"" What makes me really angry is that they try to sell us all these changes as ""making the product more exclusive for our premium pax""... other airlines are at least honest about their policies ",1

Somehow my cut and paste features can't work on SQ Talk. See www.straitstimes.com. Understand they got SGD 150 cash plus USD 50 Voucher Compensation. Offloaded despite confirmed SIA tickets ON FEB 13, my travel companions and I joined a long queue to check in for flight SQ972 to Bangkok at 9.40am, and this was when our ordeal began with Singapore Airlines. Upon checking in, a counter staff member told us that the flight was overbooked and requested that we volunteer to be offloaded. We told him that as we had paid for our golfing package we would lose money and the game if we opted to be offloaded. He then replied that since our booking was confirmed we were sure to get our seats and told us to come back 10 minutes later while he prepared the tickets. When we returned, we were told the flight was full. We were offered tickets on flight SQ976, which was departing at 4pm. We did not want to take this flight, so the staff member advised us to wait for the passenger services manager to assist us. Unfortunately, we had to wait for more than an hour for him. By this time, flight SQ972 had departed. Left with no choice, we took the later flight. Each of us was compensated $150 and given an in-flight voucher worth US$50 (S$70). The compensation could not make up for the loss of time, the frustration and anxiety we had gone through. We were exasperated that although we had fully paid and confirmed our booking many months ahead, Singapore Airlines could not guarantee our seats and spare us the ordeal of offloading. It was also dismaying that while clarifying the offloading situation, SIA wrote that its clarification was no way an indication of any liability on the company's part. Singapore Airlines should not make a passenger pay upon booking a ticket when it cannot guarantee him a seat. This would at least give the passenger the option to decide whether to travel with the airline or not. Roger Sim http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_508524.html ",1

" How can one snatch a Saver Award in First/Suites? 1) Become a TPP. 2) Get in touch with PPS Connect and ask for a waitlist to be inserted. 3) Light a candle and pray to the Gods of Controllers. 4) Enjoy your flight. In more seriousness: SIA is in the business of making money. Their revenue management will always take a view on whether or not they can sell seats and they will always keep one or two as a reserve (First Class often sells last minute). If you see six empty seats on any A380 flight departing in the next four weeks, you can pitch for waitlist approval. Non-PPS: be prepared to pay Advantage rates. ",1
" Citi PM AMEX replaces VISA!! Originally posted by j.lin View Post Today they introduce the Amex version, better earn rate. More airlines partners and even hotel partners for conversion. There is a chance that the Amex version will replace the Visa. Hopefully they don't do that. AMEX replaces VISA!! It's really a very bad idea to launch the Citi PM AMEX card. 1.4miles/S$1, I can use ANZ Travel card. VISA somemore. 2 miles/S$1 for overseas charges same rate as the Citi PM VISA card! Worse is, I cannot use it to pay bills at AXS machines!! And no Asia Miles conversion!! 1 more thing: Citibank awards points to the nearest $, ignore cents. If charge S$19.90, ANZ Travel card gets: 19.9x1.4=27.86=27 miles. Citi PM AMEX card gets: 19x1.4=26.6 miles. And if you have both the VISA and AMEX version, your Citi Miles are in separate accounts and not combined. Hence you have to pay the S$25 admin fee twice!! You can keep both the Citi PM VISA and AMEX version. BUT you cannot use the AMEX version at AXS machines to pay bills, that's where you need it for insurance premiums payment like Great Eastern Life. Don't use this card for foreign transactions, I'm sure the admin fees are very high, just like UOB PRVI AMEX. Note that miles cannot be transferred to Asia Miles!! Card transactions effected in foreign currencies which are processed by American Express will be subject to an administrative fee of up to 3.3% on the converted Singapore dollar amount, of which up to 1.5% will be retained by American Express. Conclusion: Not a good card!! ANZ Travel card wins hands down!! ",1

" Originally posted by pokfur View Post I don't think it's answered in any of the FAQs... Here's an illustration, assuming the new qualification scheme has kicked in. Example: As a QPPS i spend $35k in this year, and therefore requalify as QPP, with a $10k reserve value. In the subsequent year, do I need to just spend $40k (plus $10k reserve) to hit $50k to become Solitaire? Or do I need to actually spend $50k within that year? If it's the latter, what happens to my PPS Reserve value?? Hi pokfur, I don't think so. Based on the information, the $50k spend has to be done 'in 1 year'. So theoretically, failing to meet the $50k threshold by spending only $35k in a particular qualifying year would mean that you're back to $0 at the end of the year in terms of TPP qualification and you have to start all over again. Otherwise, it'll be just like the old system where you have 5 years to spend $250k and it doesn't matter if you spent $0 or $250k in one and you can take as long as you'd like to hit $50k so long as your reserve value doesn't expire, which will be quite 'easy' to qualify for TPP. Pretty much a 1/5 reduction in qualifying criteria. Your PPS value would still be relevant in counting towards your next year of QPP requalification in that case. ",1

" Originally posted by AsiaCommuter View Post Is there a reason why a waitlist would only be available for a Saver, yet it's not available for Advantage? I always imagined that an Advantage award (more expensive in mileage) is more likely to be available for a waitlist than a Saver.

With this situation, I assumed where a waitlist is only available for Saver, it's unlikely to clear? Any thoughts appreciated. Thanks I have even seen lower-mileage options available when the higher end one is not. Perhaps some people may prefer to burn more miles for the extra ""perk"" - like a stopover? Or that a lower-mileage tix becomes available because of a cancellation after the higher-mileage tix was already booked. Luck of the draw. I won't jump to the conclusion that such a wait-list can't clear. But if it is to a popular destination, then the likelihood will obviously not be good.

I'm burning-in the dates for my hotels and some of them are of the discounted no-change, no-refund variety, hence the desire to confirm the date for the flight. You are right, of course, about the high cost of a Y standard. I've already expended the expiring miles on my wife and son, so these that I'm using for myself are not quite expiring yet. Now that I have a firm Y Standard, I wonder if SQ will actually give me the J Saver if comes available ... or should I just cancel it and hope for the best. Not sure how accurate the seat maps are (I do know they pad it at times), but it shows about 16 seats free for Y and 5 for J. It's still 2 months before the trip, so I'm going to leave it as it is for the moment and see what gives. An alternative would be to tentatively book the CX (much cheaper) to Rome via HKG which gets me into to FCO about the same time as SQ but leaves SIN 6 hours earlier - altogether 20 hours of travel as oppose to 12! :shudder: From my limited personal experience, Experflyer is not accurate at all for Y (large number of blocked-out seats) but quite dependable for J.

If she can do it offline, then upgrades *can* be waitlisted. And I would counter because it cannot be done online, then I am forced to call the agent, at no fault of my own.

When SQ*G recently showed up on my BP, I asked the friendly LHR staff to delete any FFN so my BP showed nothing beneath my name (I could use my card to gain access to the lounges). I had to do a retro claim with CO OnePass in Houston, but at least I didn't have to claw back miles already credited to another FFP.

" Singapore Airlines is defrauding people of their money by letting them buy flexible tickets so that they apparently can upgrade to business with their miles. When the time comes to it and you want to upgrade they say that you have booked in the wrong booking class even though it clearly stated that this ticket is upgradeable when you bought this as a flexible ticket. They then hide the booking class letter i.e. S or E and replace it with your cabin class Y or whatever you think is upgradeable on that journey. The difference being cabin class and booking class. On none of the receipts, booking confirmations and seat reservations I have received it any indication of my ""booking class"". It always stated very clearly ""Y Economy"" which is upgradeable. They've done it with me and have done it with many others and they carry on with their practices. I have reported them to the aviation authority and UK ombudsman and hope to help a few people to get their money back for false advertising. Be aware of this when you you buy your tickets.

" I was on SIN-PVG flight 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised with the chinese meal. It was a complete set (appetizer, soup, main course, and dessert), just like kyo kaiseki menu. When I asked the LSS about it, she said it's just been recently introduced (around March). Here's the details from SQ website: 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn) First Class customers travelling on selected flights between Singapore and China can look forward to a new Chinese fine dining experience with the introduction of 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn), an elegant and complete Chinese meal available for lunch or dinner service. The name - translated in English as treasured culinary creations from a famed and reputable establishment - highlights the partnership between renowned master chefs and the Airline. 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn) is specially created for Singapore Airlines by acclaimed masterchefs Sam Leong and Zhu Jun, both members of our International Culinary Panel and renowned authorities in the art of Chinese cuisine. First Class customers will be treated to timeless Chinese fare made up of an exquisite array of ingredients that will impress even the most discerning of palettes. Anyway, it was really really good and super tasty. I really recommend it! It's a pity this menu is not available for book the cook as I rarely fly to China.. Here are some pictures (a bit blurry, sorry). Appetizer and soup Main course (beef with black bean sauce, black cod fish, shimeji rice) ",0
" At least SQ recognizes LH*G status for priority waitlist/seating in some fashion, rather than the other way around, so I would go for SEN. However, it is really beneficial flying on LH - you get op-upped quite a bit! Upon obtaining SEN, and keeping the LH M&M number in the record, got an op-up for the first time in my life on LH (versus UA*G)! (I had to forcefully take away the SWU from the lounge dragon, who didn't know what was going on, and wanted to take the upgrade voucher anyway! I had already taken it away, when I could see that she couldn't access the system) ",1

If they change their stated policies such that you can *only* earn PPS Value if you also credit your miles to SQ, that would be a major factor for me to take my business elsewhere. I have no desire to bank miles in KrisFlyer only to have them evaporate. If the original stated purpose of PPS Value vs. the old sector system was to fairly reward people for the actual money spent with SQ, then I have no idea why they would force customers to also bank miles with SQ (which are actually a liability on their balance sheet, not an asset). Is this yet another ""enhancement"" to the PPS Club we are supposed to like? ",1

" Originally posted by SQueeze View Post Firstly, the crucial question is how many miles do you have for burning???? 1. To answer Q1. You should do a comparison chart and see which one has less nett mileage requirement. You need to have a specific destination first and then do the detailed calculation including miles spent, miles earned if on upgrade, and all the associated taxes. Different routes will have different scenarios so you have to do this homework first. 2. Best ratio is at saver levels, at the highest cabin class (F savers), and to the furthest destination which is Sao Paulo. And flying out of Sao Paulo means almost zero surcharges. Only USD45 from there to Singapore but only from there, not if you buy a return flight from Singapore. You can tag SQ67 to any Southeast destinations for free. For example Sao Paulo-Singapore-Manila. But I like Jakarta because 3 of the planes going there has retrofitted F. And my roots are there. 3. I don't know how to compare with TG. Can't help you with this one. Thanks for the reply. No destination in mind for now The purpose is to just fly F class. So I need to find the route that still have F class and try to collect point to achive it Since the longer the distance I believe the more miles requirement so I may looking something around 6-8 hours flight to balance between mileage requirement and the duration to enjoy the F class. I am thinking may be Tokyo/Seoul. Looking at SQ website it require 60,000x2 miles for F savers. So any better deal for about 6-8 hours flight? ",1

I'll be flying in from YYC that morning - I haven't bought my ticket yet but looking to purchase a flight on AC4364 which arrives at 930 in SFO so I should have plenty of time to make the connection. The question I had was what will happen if the AC flight is delayed causing me to miss my SQ flight? Is there a way to link my two flights as they will be ticketed separately, i.e. should I go through SQ to book my AC flight so they are aware of the connection or will I just forfeit the flight and have to book a separate one if the worst case scenario happens? Many thanks mingster As it is a SQ redemption, in the worst case scenario you become a no-show and take the next available flight which may as well be SQ1 after paying the no-show fee ",1

The ""NRT//HND"" is considered a surface sector and thus incurs a VOID coupon in between the flight sectors. Do the flight sectors have 'OPEN' under 'Status'? If however every coupon is showing 'VOID', it sounds like they made some sort of mistake and have voided this ticket. They should then be reissuing your itinerary with a fresh ticket almost immediately after. You might want to ring up to enquire if you've not received your reissued e-ticket.

" Originally posted by alex0683de View Post There's one more thing to keep in mind: LH miles do not expire as long as you hold any status (HON, SEN or FTL). If you lose status you entire mileage balance is treated as if you earned it on the day you lost your status, and is given the full three year validity your miles would be subject to on a blue account. If you requalify for status at some point during this three year period, the miles go back to indefinite validity, and will be reset with an expiration date three years after the date you lose this new status. I hope that made sense. I'll give you an example. Say you earn 50K miles on a trip as a blue member in August 2007. These miles are valid until 30 September 2010 (end of the quarter you earned them, plus three years). In June 2010, you qualify for SEN. Your miles from 2007 are saved from expiry. Your status is valid until February 2013. You don't manage to requalify SEN by 2013. LH bumps you down to FTL. That status is valid until February 2016. You don't manage to requalify FTL by 2016. Your status disappears entirely. Your miles are now set with an expiration date of 31 March 2019 (end of the quarter plus three years). If you requalify for FTL by March 2019, all miles are valid as long as your status is, plus another three years. If you know how to play the game, it's incredibly difficult to let your LH miles expire. Oh, and by the way - it's no longer just the German LH credit card that keeps your miles active indefinitely. http://www.miles-and-more.com/online...st=96807496701 It's mostly other European countries though, Japan being the notable exception.

Trip report coming in less than a week btw. I am writing it. First, have you checked if MEL-SIN-IST-TSE IS considered a valid routing? This is because you will be going to Middle East sector to get to The Central/South Asia zone. From Singapore, no routing to TSE is valid whether it is via China/Korea or Turkey as per my last check. They insisted on 2 separate bookings which will be too expensive. From Australia, the China route seems to be fairly linear. You might be left with this option only. As far as possible, put everything in one booking. It's not just the security but you should be saving a lot of miles too esp *A award is still the same since 2011. For myself, I flew from Delhi. It's fairly cheap from there. About $500 return. Sometimes I see prices as Low as $300 too. Nice to know I'm not alone in wanting to head to TSE on a redemption! I'm fully expecting heaps of fine print and surprise rules to prevent a *A redemption. Nothing airlines do is ever transparent, no matter how simple they make things look on their websites. The simplest way, most likely, is to get myself a J saver redemption return to a nearby city and then book a Y return from that city to TSE. The only hassle is that it means without doubt two separate bookings. If I have to go with this option, I'm leaning toward IST as the layovers are longer so I don't need to stress about connections and I hear better stories about TK and the lounge at IST than I do about CA. If something went wrong at PEK with my connection, I'm stranded in China without a confirmed visa, having to buy an additional ticket. Having said that, if I can't get my luggage checked through to TSE and have to go out to collect it, would they let me check in 10 hours before my flight so I can then go into the lounge? My travel insurance might also be invalid as Istanbul is currently registered by the AU government as a dangerous location. I'd look into DEL but flying with KC offers me no elite mileage accrual and doesn't offer lounge access via KFEG privileges. The flights would have to line up really well and I'd need to look into transit visa requirements. ",1

" Originally posted by fone View Post Ooops, just saw your question today. Two separate PNRs is good as you'd get more visibility if 1 seat clears. I can't remember if this is the case with SQ, where if 1 seat is available, it is not reserved for you if you have 2 passengers in a PNR. Anyway, I got my PNR of 4 split into 3+1, but both PNR ended up clearing at the same time. I know this is the case for BR as I have a PNR for 4, waitlisted, but tried to book for 3 and it was bookable! I'd say chaser does works, at least I believe in them (there's no way for me to re-do everything and test what happens if I do not send a chaser). Also, you'd have to be next in the waitlist, I do not think that there is any way they can clear yours before those ahead of you. With the current PPS changes, they get priority (if you're not one of them). Then during your waiting time, they could have leap-frog in front of you. That could be why the agents say it doesn't look promising (either that or the flight is quite full). I usually request to send one every week for flights that are about 1-2 months away, or every few weeks for those very far out. I also had flights cleared without chasers. If you still have time, I'd call in for the chaser once every week, no matter how bad the agent thinks it looks. Some chaser works, some don't (at least this is how it seems). My SIN - SFO flight was cleared way in advance, but ended up to be a full flight in J. For the available day before, if you're fine with the date, then why not book that (or if they can hold it for you first)? IMO, it is also easier for them to clear your waitlist if you already have someone on the flight. I had a flight to Japan where the first time I called for the chaser, I did not mention my companion on the same flight/class of service, the chaser was not very effective. Few days later, I called again, mentioned that and the seat became available within 24 hours (this was for <2 weeks departure and flight was not full) Thanks Fone. I will keep phoning SQ for chaser, maybe as you suggest, once a week or more. The last time I did it, the agent declined to send a chaser - maybe I have sent too many. When I went to ION, I was also told that folks with status could leapfrog ahead. I have no idea where I am in the queue but after I booked the waitlist, the flight is no longer redeemable at Saver. I looked at the seat map and the plane looks quite empty, except 2 bulkhead rows blocked (A350). I do not have a confirmed person on this waitlisted flight, so can't really make that case. That said, I am happy with the return dates that are now reserved for me; I haven't ticketed them yet but they are on hold. The agents have also kindly given me bulkhead seats in the new J, so I'm really happy with the flights. Wonder if I should just drop the waitlist, which are there just to extend the (leisure) trip to CPT for 2 more days (instead of 3.5) ",1

" [Note: Thread initiated in old SQTalk Forum] shortfinals Founding SQTalker « Thread started on: Aug 8th, 2006, 11:24am » I thought about this one as it was asked somewhere else.......... and came up with this..... The highest Q number anyone can possibly have is 16. Here's how it works. Joe bloke starts work and flies J SIN-CGK only, and he does only 10 Rt's a year. in 9 Years, he is QPP9, and has 225 lifetime sectors. (SIN-CGK was chosen since it's got the lowest mile/sector at 445.6miles to 1 sector) At that time, however, he crucially only has 125460 PPS miles. Joe then gets transferred to KUL, and flies KUL-SIN only. He needs 500000 miles in total now since he ain't doing CGK runs anymore, so will not qualify on sectors (KUL-SIN was chosen, but any sector under 482 miles will do) As luck would have it, Joe flies precisely 91 RT's a year in F KUL-SIN for 50232 pps miles every year. He's still on 225 lifetime sectors though. The remaining 374540 he needs for TPP (500000-125460), is acquired over another 7 years (not 8 as you might think, since he qualifies on just over 50000). Your lifetime counter still ticks, but your year on year counter is reset to 0. So Joe then qualifies for QPP16 at 50232 miles for the year as usual, and at 477,084 miles lifetime, 225 sectors lifetime. Halfway through his QPP17 qualifying year, he reaches the magic 500000 and becomes TPP. The numbers still work out the same even if it is calculated using some other sector, as long as the sector is under 482 miles. That, my friends, is NOT the way to become TPP.

And to enter the International Concourse, the checker only allowed pax departing from International Councourse. There was a bus that connect from UA domestic to International Terminal in the secure area. But again, to gain access, the pax has to have BP or confirmed itinerary proof for the flight departing from International Terminal councourse. ",0
 I have enough points to upgrade from J to F travelling from MEL to Europe return. As we know there are no F Saver options from MEL with SQ so that rules that one out as I cant afford nor will pay Standard or Full. Am I right in saying that I have no other option to get to Europe in F as I cant think of another S* carrier that offers F from MEL? is my only option maybe to fly with TG from SYD and upgrade to F that way? Would rather avoid TG if I can but my options are limited as I really want to fly F. ,1

" TPP Birthday Upgrade &amp; PPS Rewards Stand-By Upgrade execution I was fortunate enough to score a Birthday upgrade (from J to F) for quite a long flight (SIN-LAX) recently. I don't make it a point to travel on or around my birthday to score the upgrade, and the last time I travelled on SQ one day before my birthday I was already in F. So I was curious of how it works. Having checked in at CGK airport (my route was CGK-SIN-LAX), I finally got my SIN-LAX upgrade to F only at boarding time in SIN. Even though I am thankful SQ is doing this, wouldn't it be nice to just award the upgrade at check in at CGK? After all, the F seat SIN-LAX was available at check in (yes, I was monitoring the flight loads with ExpertFlyer). Giving away the upgrade at last minute during boarding seems a bit petty in my opinion. After all, how many TPPs travels on their birthday really? Frankly I don't know if my experience was the standard, or an anomaly. Can anyone else share their experience? Is the birthday upgrade given at check in at origin airport? Or at gate? Now I have a couple of standby upgrades (part of PPS rewards) to be used on my future flights. T & C is as follows (bold emphasis mine): Terms and conditions PPS Rewards are valid for 12 months from the date of issue. Standby Upgrade applications must be submitted at least 48 hours before your flight. Upgrades are not guaranteed upon application of the PPS Reward, and are subject to seat availability upon check-in at the airport. This PPS Reward may be used by the principal PPS Club member or their redemption nominee. Each Upgrade Reward can only be used for one traveller, per flight segment. This PPS Reward may be combined with a Double KrisFlyer Miles Reward. Check terms and conditions for Double KrisFlyer Miles Reward. This PPS Reward can only be used if the original commercial booking is in the following classes: Economy class - Y, B, E, M, H, W; Premium Economy Class - S, T; Business Class - Z, C, J, U. Standby Upgrades can only be used for upgrades on flights operated and marketed by Singapore Airlines or SilkAir. This excludes codeshare flights marketed by Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, and operated by codeshare partners, as well as codeshare flights marketed by codeshare partners, and operated by Singapore Airlines or SilkAir. Only one Standby Upgrade can be used for one flight segment, and is applicable only for one-cabin class upgrades. This means that two Standby Upgrades cannot be used in conjunction for a double upgrade (e.g. from Economy Class to First Class, or Economy Class to Business Class, on an aircraft that offers Premium Economy Class). The PPS Reward cannot be combined with a redemption ticket (including HighFlyer) or with a redemption upgrade. This PPS Reward cannot be combined with mySQupgrade. KrisFlyer terms and conditions apply. I am curious to see how this works as well. Wait until last minute unsold seats? Or really upgrade at check-in as per the T & C? Would appreciate any sharing of your experience as well. ",1

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post SQ can conduct as many audits on accounts as they want. But freezing a PPS account because the transfer was missing out a middle name is obscene. How much more can you dishonor a relationship that was a trusted one for many years? Big thumbs down. PPS used to be a status that was worth it. The question I have is for how long was the account frozen for? To do it correctly, some auditors need accounts/inventory to be frozen for a finite time so that they can total everything up without the numbers changing while they're in the process. If the account was frozen on suspicion of fraud, then that's a whole different thing altogether. In which case one can go, ""humpf, how dare you even think I will ever do such thing!"" ",1

 I think you can change your redemption booking online unless there are seats available in your redemption class. Going to the KF call centre will only lose your 15% discount. That I'm pretty sure cos I've done it before. Yeah i think the best way is to call them. They should waive it if it's the system problem. ,1

" I was reading about the lady Ms Low Wai Yeng's talking about the compensation as follows from the Straits Time Internet edition on their forum page: QUOTE ""In response to XXXX's post of a compensation of US$400, do you seriously think that SIA will give such a generous compensation? I seriously doubt so. As for waiting for the next flight, they only told me that I will be downgraded 10 mins before boarding. The ground staff told me she will try to check whether there are seats on other airlines. Again, there are no promises. If there are no other available flights, I will have to continue to wait at the airport. Anyone who has traveled on a business trip will know the feelings where you just can't wait to get home to see your family. To be me the only logical thing to do is to just grab the last economy class seat on the flight."" UNQUOTE. Sounds liked no compensation has been offered in LHR just liked what happened to the gentleman I know for his CGK - SIN. Of course it will be interesting to know if these are exceptional situation where compensation are not offered or it is a new policy where nothing is offered?

" Miles &amp; Cash finally official When were those Krisflyer feedback sessions when they told people about this ?. Oh yeah, 2010 !!!!. I suppose they've be thinking about what rates they can get away with... Dear Mr MAN Flyer, We are pleased to inform you that from 18 July 2013, you will be able to use your KrisFlyer miles to pay for all, or a part of your Singapore Airlines or SilkAir airfare (including taxes and surcharges) when you book on singaporeair.com With this new payment option, you may combine your miles with cash (payable with credit/debit card) to pay for an airfare on your desired flight, instead of waiting for that award ticket and/or flight upgrade to become available. Plus, with only a minimum of about 5,000 KrisFlyer miles to start, this feature will also allow you to use smaller amounts of miles in your account that may be expiring. To start, all you need to do is log in at singaporeair.com and check the 'Pay with KrisFlyer miles' box before searching for your flight(s). You may also like to know that in subsequent enhancements, you can use your KrisFlyer miles to cover the cost of taxes and surcharges associated with your redemption award tickets. We hope you will benefit from this new initiative, the latest in a series of revamps made to the KrisFlyer programme. You can look forward to hearing from us in the coming months as we work on further improvements to our loyalty programme. Thank you and we look forward to welcoming you onboard soon. Yours sincerely, Shirlene Teo Manager Loyalty Marketing ",1

" Overall impressions? A decent lounge, larger than the SQ Silver Kris Lounge in the satellite terminal, but very similar to the Asiana Lounge in the satellite terminal. In fact, I would say the Asiana Lounge in the satellite terminal holds its own against the main terminal in almost all respects. I would say the two Asiana lounges are largely equivalent, except that the main lounge has some views of the tarmac. Unless the tarmac views mean a lot to you, I would still pick the Asiana Business Lounge in the satellite terminal as first choice if you are flying SQ, mainly because of the proximity to the SQ boarding gates.

What TPR like before a morning flight - Breakfast time before SQ308 0905 SIN-LON? I have been in the evenings only and it was lovely (it was very quiet) Whats the best experience that I can get - ie what time to check in etc. I am staying in SIN the night before and am flying in Suites (First time so Im quite excited). The invitation has a date written on it and that's the day of your First/Suites flight. You don't need the invitation to get into the TPR as it's more a symbolic gesture and you can get access by just showing your boarding pass as well. The only thing that sets the TPR apart from the FCL is the fact that you can do a a la carte dinner. That's very limited and boring in the morning. If you want to 'experience' the TPR, you are better of on a night flight. ",0

" Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post I think your conclusion may be a bit strong. There are suggestions that PPS membership is on its way to becoming a shadow of its former self, but a gulf will remain between PPS and Elite Gold. The only question is: will the reductions in service be enough to dissuade people from making the extra effort to qualify? [This question may not really be that relevant for business flyers whose companies foot the bill for (re)qualification, and whose travel patterns take them on SQ to start with.] I am already taking extra effort to qualify because all the PPS qualifications are mostly out of personal travels. Business travels are normally regional anyway, and they are mostly in Y, unless I have the miles to upgrade it to C. At least, right now, I am still committed towards qualification for QPP1 at least. I believe I will get it this year. But, if SQ continue to marginalize PPS wannabe like me, I might even think twice of requalifying for it next year ",1

" Overall impressions? On the positive side, I found the F&B to be very good, and the fact that they now have bathrooms/showers to be a big plus. In terms of seating and lounging, this is decent, and the lounge did not fill up when I was there, so it was quite comfortable. The decor is very much the latest SQ house style for the lounge, and whether that appeals to you is very much a matter of personal taste. The fact that it was a windowless room still meant that I much preferred walking around outside the airy terminal, rather than spend too much time sitting in the lounge. How does it compare with the competition in HKG? Well, competition in HKG is fierce. So while the SQ lounge is a perfectly decent lounge overall, with very good catering, it is to some extent shown up by the competition. The CX lounges remain superb. No contest there. The difference is night and day in CX's favour. I also prefer the QF lounge. Even the UA/Star Alliance lounge at the other end of the terminal has a more open and airy feel, although F&B options in the UA lounge are quite limited. All that said, if you need a quick pit stop in transit on SQ1/2, or need to grab a quick bite or a drink before your flight, then the SQ lounge is fine. I for one normally just go in for a few minutes for a drink or snack, maybe to use the bathroom/shower, then head outside again where the terminal itself has a lot more to see and do than in the lounge.

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post Disagree. PPS Value is actually a decision I strongly support. From an airline point of view, you want to pamper those customers who make the most money - showing up 200 times for the cheapest eco fare on SIN-BKK and then expect special treatment... Why? Another reason is that qualification by miles is a very variable income: In times where fares are high, SQ makes a lot of money - with the current promos, making it to PPS would be only half the revenue for them. We agree on the benefits part then. Now... who said anything about giving PPS to those flying purely Y?? Not me. But I do say 25-35 sectors in F or J is a better way to reward loyalty. It's not the pax fault if the global economy crashes and SQ has to cut fares. What you are suggesting is that the loyal customer that regularly does 3 longhaul trips a year in J, qualified under the old 25 sectors rule, and qualified under the $25k PPSV rule, now deserves to LOSE QPP or TPP because cheaper fares don't add up to $25k??? I think not. IMHO this is another major (previously unforeseen) flaw in the PPSV system. Loyalty is loyalty, whether fares are high or low, and it should be appropriately rewarded. ",1

As long as the merchant code is an airline or travel agency, you get 2 miles for each SG dollar equivalent of foreign currency transacted. DCC type of transaction will not earn 2 miles.

Below are the final MYR/SGD currency conversion rates (all inclusive): UOB Privi Miles AMEX = 2.397 Maybank Horizon VISA = 2.420 Citibank PremierMiles VISA = 2.421 That's hardly surprising given that we already know that the UOB Amex charges a higher commission (3.25% vs 2.5% for Premiermiles). On the other hand, consider that you are also earning more miles, you need to decide if the 0.5 miles per $ is worth paying that extra 0.75% (thereabouts) more. ",1

 I was flying SQ 322 SIN-LHR on 4th Aug in Suites. About an hour before the flight I was in TPR when all of a sudden I heard a loud commotion. A woman was shouting to another man to get off her partner. Shortly after this the lounge ladies quickly ran off shouting to call for the police and later returned with a first aid kit. As I left the lounge I asked the lady on the door what happened (because of the privacy set up of TPR I couldn't see anything). Apparently here is how the story goes. A man (alone) who had too much to drink was speaking very loudly (call him man1). A guy (man2) who was with his girlfriend/wife asked man1 if he minded keeping his voice down. Man1 reacted by punching man2 in the face and man1 had to be pulled off man2. Man1 then proceeded to leave the lounge quickly as the lounge staff tried to get him to wait there for the police to arrive. I ask the lady on the door which flight these people were on and she said they were both on my flight...how lovely. As I arrived at the gate I saw one of the ladies from the room stood at the security with two police men. It seemed she was waiting to identify the man. On board I told the crew all about this and they didn't know anything about it. Later they came back and said both men were in the lounge speaking to police. A little while later man2 got on the plane with a black eye and cuts and blood all over his face. The crew confirmed man1 was off loaded and arrested. Well I do like the TPR but I have always found it so quiet that I dare not speak. I have lived in Singapore for over 6 years and have never seen anyone fighting. How funny that the first time I do is in TPR of all places! As for the flight it was as amazing as long haul suites ever is and the crew were the best I have ever experienced.

" Hi everyone! This will be my second post and I decided to write a review about the recently renovated SilverKris Lounge at Hong Kong International Airport. Hope y'all like it! Before my flight back home on SQ861, I had some time to check out the recently renovated SilverKris Lounge at Hong Kong Airport. https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0387.jpg The ambience of the lounge was warm and inviting. It was well-furnished with many comfortable seats and sofas. The interior of lounge was tasteful and interesting: https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0394.jpg For drinks, I went with a glass of Champagne. I think it was Dom Pérignon. The bar inside the lounge had various other cocktails including the usual Bloody Marys and Singapore Slings. https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0396.jpg For noms noms I ordered a bowl of Laksa. Haha, I never imagined that I would eat a bowl of Laksa in Hong Kong so this was quite an experience! The dish was more of a novelty, really, and wasnt quite near the standards of say, 328 Katong Laksa, but it was quite tasty nonetheless. 😊 The noodles were cooked well but the gravy was a bit on the sweet side. https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0399.jpg Soon it was time to board the plane. Gate 15 was just outside the lounge so boarding the plane from the lounge was really convenient! 😄 Overall, the experience at SilverKris Hong Kong was pretty good! A solid 8/10! 😄 ",0

" hi guys, i'm really kinda lost and frustrated about this whole qualifying period requirement and all so if someone could please help me verify what sq/kf is trying to say here, i'd be more than grateful. thanks. i wrote them last month arguing about the inherently unfair system about having to clock 25k miles for ES and thereafter another 50k to qualify for EG, which was when i received a reply stating that exceptions are available for first time EG qualifiers, of which I am one. Hence, the email went on to say I am still well on track for EG with 25k miles, and not 50k as states on the website. sweet news right? uhm, yes and no because in my case i wrote to say that i knew i'd be having some sfo-sin-sfo flights this year, hence i would be able to hit 50k between jan-sept/oct this year, but unfortunately there is this thing about the flights not being within the qualifying year. i went on to say also that if i had known about this qualifying period thing, i would've thrown my old KF account with that 5k+ miles in it and reregistered for a new one. the reply i received yesterday states that I have only accrued 44044 elite miles and hence would require another 5956 elite miles by 30 April 2009 to qualify for EG. here's a short log of my Star Alliance flights this year. x As you can see, i accumulated 53085miles from Jan till yeart till now. and fyi, there were about 5227miles from last/previous years. it may also be helpful to note that i was only awarded ES on 18 August 2008, so I'm suspecting that the Jan flights i had on UA were not counted towards this qualifying period (guess my previous qp is April-April). Or can someone please help me understand better if i've got it all screwd up? Matt_will_fix_it, i need your help now. which manager did you eventually write to? i mean, i did get that response from one mr Thong, which i told matt about, but the most recent email i wrote to was just sent to the generic feedback@krisflyer.com.sg email and was subsequently answered by Ms. Sri Eryani. i'm not too sure if i agree entirely with what she's saying since the first time i wrote to KF about having my UA miles transferred to KF, i had a response stating that it was not doable after the miles had been creditted to another FFP. I wish to note that after some more writing, this was rectified. Is there a way now I can get them to include my Jan flights to count towards my Elite miles? thanks so much and I appreciate all your help and feedback. thanks. ",1

Lufthansa has separate Senator and Business Lounges at their hubs, and while I have not been to their Business Lounges, the Senator Lounges (for Star Gold) are far superior to the equivalent Star Gold lounges at SQ's home base in Singapore.

Originally posted by Guy Betsy View Post [b] * So doing all those flights and sectors that you do in F, J and the odd Y (that everyone here knows about) isn't screaming just that? As you mentioned earlier, I recalled about LAX staff who mentioned to you about SQ noticing those low fares to get PPS, the PPS sectors/miles real measurement is sectors/miles, no $$$ amount. Each QPP has his/her own way to earn that 25 sectors (This is the usual easy way to qualify, right?). One can fly just once in a round-the-world ticket. One can do can do couple of special lower J/F tickets. One can qualify due to those Kangaroo route biz trip. In short, each QPP has ""secret"" $$$ amount. With the new proposed qualification, then it's clearly a QPP is someone who spend at least SGD25K or more. In the ""old"" PPS, someone can get PPS for much less than that amount. That's why I said there is no more dynamics in the new PPS Club. Just flaunting your $$$ for everyone else to see. I must say that I was hoping that SQ/PPS management was to modify the previous PPS sectors/miles requalification. The data for couple years can tell the average of PPS flyers earned within the period of requalification. Some would have just around 25 PPS sectors, some would be around 35, etc etc, and some would be more than 150. By looking at those numbers, I am sure the decision makers can have a cutting point where they can reduce the number of PPS which they claimed now too many around. Do a subset for very short-haul PPS like the SIN-CGK flyers. Change the earning sectors there. But again, the milk has spilled. Nothing we can do about it. PPS with that $$$ amount would have more headache for calculating the $$$ amount for mixed airlines. And a suggestion by someone to count 618 ticket would create big loopholes. Imagine a tix 618 with just CGK-SIN as first segment and the rest is on other airlines! Anyway, as others have mentioned about higher fares on SQ and big devaluation in miles redemption, certainly I agree with others who say that there is no need for them to go out their way just to take SQ.

" Originally posted by GR1 View Post do not work at all I'm not sure I'd agree with this. If you do not have sufficient status with SQ and if you are redeeming on a popular flight during the peak holiday travelling season, then yes sending chasers probably won't work, as understandably you'd be quite far down the pecking order on a nearly full flight. That's just how it works with items that are scarce. What does work quite reliably is when I redeem a ticket for my partner when I am flying on a paid ticket on the same flight. Usually clears within the same day. Under other, more general circumstances, I'd say chasers work about 25~50% of the time for me (non-Solitaire PPS for 6 years). One >10-year Solitaire PPS I know claims that he almost always clears his waitlists. Helps if you have a convincing reason why SQ should open up/release the award seat for you, or let you jump the queue, e.g. if you have confirmed sectors in the same booking and require just that last one to complete the ticket. So the key is to be flexible with your travel plans -- waitlist as many flights as you can, and consider flying into alternative airports (e.g. MUC instead of FRA). And avoid December unless you are making plans 355 days out. ",1

" Originally posted by demue View Post Wow Economy Saver award booking privileges to folks who qualify flying premium cabin Guess you are supposed to be reminded of how it feels in the back of the bus Now change that Business Saver and you are talking actual tangible benefits. Indeed. SQ have a 'loyalty' programme for which you can only obtain status by flying in Premium Cabins, and they are hard faced enough to then promote one of the benefits of being a guaranteed seat in a cabin that those who qualified for status cannot use for it. Genius. Maybe those folks at SQ currently sat in the secret bunker with those consultants trying to find ways to add value to the programme could indeed start by offering TPP's guaranteed access to JCL award bookings instead of these birthday upgrades that many of those who spend a lot of time on the road will not be able to use as we try to avoid travelling then. Originally posted by CarbonMan View Post Hmm ... thanks for giving me ideas on how I can make some money with TPP. Yeah, SQ knows that some of us are at the pointy end only because the company pays for it. When we are on our personal trips, we're the cheapest el-cheapos you can find! I am not sure about that. The idea that after flying north of 100 (and sometimes 150) flights a year I will then get on another aircraft to fly on holiday in Y is stretching it somewhat. I think most heavy travellers make us of the Miles & Status for their holidays. I was contemplating that, but I won't unless I'm convinced that Solitaire is nothing more than red carpets and ego. It depends what use you can make of it. The main benefit of TPP for most is the supplementary card and for me it's getting access to upgrades and awards in J and particularly F when it's not possible to get them on line and also to free up revenue seats at very short notice, which I regularly need to do. An email to my PPS co-ordinator tends to open doors that are otherwise shut, and I have to say it does make the programme worthwhile. It does for me anyway, but I have a rather fab PPS co-ordinator.

Agent initially said ""there is no use to enter the KF number Sir, as you won't be getting any miles from this award ticket"". I explained the reason, and she then proceeded. 3) Agent asked for the account holder's birthdate and nationality for verification.

Has anyone tried with success? Also, would it be possible to get a stopover in Zurich or Frankfurt? Thanks so much for your help. ",1

It does look quite reasonable, on LH That's a good question actually, seeing as I'm making this reservation about a year before I travel. What are the chances that they'll switch the aircraft to a 388. I'm not sure what happens if it switches to a 777 though. Because technically you can't take saver flights on a 777 aircraft... anyone know the answer to this? Technically, if you have already issued your F saver redemption ticket and then SQ change the aircraft of your flight in the future, SQ will honor your F saver ticket and accommodate you accordingly.... If SQ change your flight into A388, then you will get ""suites""... If SQ change your flight into B773W, then you will get the ""diamond plus""... That was how I got my ""suite"".... And do as Pinkfloyd said as a reference in case they try to do that (but in my case, my booking switched automatically into R (suites) without any word was spoken, and I even called them to make seat arrangement... ) About changing date after SQ change the aircraft, that's still a mystery for me...

" I have been a Solitaire for 25 years, I would switch and have talked about switching but CX, wont give me equal status and have to start from the bottom in the USA from the bottom and work my way up and not really interested in doing that.I find now on SQ only about 50 percent of the time that I get welcomed by the IFS on a flight and 50 percent of the time does a Flight Attendant remember my name without looking at a piece of paper. The service has dropped some flights like I just went SIn-Sydney , the crew was like the old Sq, on the return to Sing it almost like flying United, after the meal service most of the crew stayed in the galley and were chatting it up, hardly saw anyone in the cabin.

" Originally posted by pogonation View Post When I said 1 seat on this sector is available to partner airlines I meant: If you search HKG-SIN using ANA award finder then it shows that 1 seat is available to *A partners. However when I search this sector alone on KF it shows waitlist only. I found this strange. HKG-SIN is waitlist by itself and if booked as HKG-DPS. SIN-DPS is available both by itself and when including the HKG-SIN leg. The problem for me is that I am wanting to trade miles with a FT member to get SQ miles (I do not use KF) so I am really wondering what my chances are of getting 2 seats fast if I waitlist? I have never waitlisted before so I don't know what to expect. I can't risk making a trade and then the SQ miles being worthless to me. Well ANA is not always that reliable when it comes to SQ. As I have shared in other threads I have been looking at SIN-FUK, SIN-HND (on A330) and SIN-NRT (on 773 refurb) IIRC and ANA shows the C seats as available. However, when I go into KF it does the same than in your case and shows waitlist. I tried to book those seats ANA shows via BD and LH (for sampling purposes) and both could see the seats but not confirm them. Looks like SQ is publishing some 'phantom' inventory or waitlist to *A FFPs. Not sure, but if KF says waitlist then your best shot is to use KF miles, do th ewaitlist and often it will clear in my experience. Fingers crossed. ",1

" Just wanted to share my experience with this new card's Limo service. They don't use the usual SMRT or Comfort Mercedes cabs, instead they outsourced it to a private vendor who has a fleet of Mercedes limos of various sizes. Used it twice and will really think twice about using their service again. Trip #1. Eve of departure, never receive a call or SMS to remind me of the service unlike other free limo rides i have taken from other banks. Had to call the vendor directly to confirm my booking. The limo that came was a huge Maxicab-like black Mercs limo. Driver confirmed with me the destination and I told him to use the main road to the expressway when he asked if he can use another ""shortcut"" via Seletar to TPE. I agreed since I thought he should know the way as he asked for it. End up he got lost and I had to help him find a way to the expressway. Wasted 15 mins. Trip #2. Booked 1 month earlier. Driver called 1 day later to ask me to remind him 2 days before the trip in case he forgets. Eve of departure, again, no calls or SMS to confirm the service. Sent driver a SMS with my address to confirm and he replied Ok. Actual day at 5.15am, i got down early to wait for my 5.20am ride which simply never turned up. 5 mins past the agreed timing, I texted the driver. No response. Another 5 mins passed and I called the driver. Seems like it's a different driver picking up the call and he alleged that I was a no-show as he came to my block at 3.20am - and he quoted my block number WRONGLY! Though he did apologise and says I can make a claim from UOB or from them after I kicked up a big fuss with him while hurriedly hailing a cab for my 7.10am flight, the damage is already done.

Is it good? It sounded interesting but i didn't want to see seafood and pasta drowning in a cream sauce. 3)Ex FRA: Like MEL, quite a limited selection. Was going to go with the lobster (boring), but changed to the roasted Veal Knuckle with bavarian bread dumplings. Has anyone had this? Sounds hearty and local. 4) Ex JFK: Quite a few good options. This one I really can't decide. I ordered the long Island Duck in natural jus. Any good? I am also equally torn with the other 2 contenders: Roasted sea bass with wilted spinach and glazed crab-mashed potatoes and Grilled shrimps and scallops in tarragon mustard sauce with leeks, carrots, and linguini Having agonised over these choices...I'm a sucker for lobster, no matter what it looks like, so if any of the above choices are not that good, tell me and i will gravitate to the default setting.

" Welcome to SQT, BKKFLYER. The consensus here is that possibly except for frequent flyers who also have KrisFlyer-affiliated credit cards, KrisFlyer lost a lot of its appeal after the recent massive devaluation. Even if SQ leaves KF untouched in 2011, there are more generous *A FFPs, depending on your travel and earning patterns and redemption preferences. Fortunately you can achieve QPP even if you bank your miles in a partner FFP. If you travel with your family, the QPP baggage allowance can be very nice. As LionCity pointed out, QPP privileges were also hacked down in the Great Devaluation. As for QPP qualification, it looks simple on the face of it: S$25,000 spending in your membership year. The actual PPSV of your ticket, though, may not be so easy to deduce if your ticket isn't a straightforward return fare (e.g., part of a RTW). ",1

If you are flying enough in the next year that those benefits are worthwhile, then you will probably qualify in the next year anyway. For GBP300, you can treat yourself to many things that are likely worth more than EG benefits. Just an opinion of course! Hi yflyer It would be a mileage run, however it looks like I can do it cheaper by changing the booking class and opt for the cheaper/lower class and get 50% miles as directed by cowie, I can use the flight to purchase Cigarettes etc in Brussels and the savings in paying UK tobacco duty will help to cover the cost of flight, EG also gives me 50kg luggage and as I normally exceed the standard 30kg's I can again save on excess baggage and at $63 per kg (band 1 to band 4) flying 3 to 4 times a year it will be quite a saving, also as I normally fly on SQ322 waiting for my bags at LHR is painful not being priority. So a decision has to be made! Thanks for you comments I will let you know how I get on Regards Richplug ",1
" Originally posted by adamantine View Post I notice that booking for 2 suite seats to places like JFK on 380 red eye flights are almost always on waitlist. But if you book 1 seat, it is available. In that respect, is it possible to book 1 seat at a time, and do it twice to get both the seats you want? When I select one seat, I see that only 2 other suite seats have been taken up which leads me to think that there should be at least 2 more to be used for redemption? In the case where I am wrong, can I call SQ to clear the waitlist for the second individually booked seat and will they allow this if they know you tried to book 2 seats on 2 separate instances? On a related note, how many suite seats are often available for redemption on the 380s? Since there are only a few Suites available, SQ may only put one up for redemption booking. If in the event no one else pays for the other seats, then they are awarded to the waitlist on a priority basis. Yes, you can try to book it using the method you mentioned. If it doesn't work out the way you want, you can cancel them so long as the miles haven't expired at the time of the cancellation. Different booking references should not be an issue. As to how many seats are made available in F for redemption .... one or at best two, I would hazard a guess, probably the former. On some popular routes, they may not even have any firm ones available. Just have to waitlist. I have a flight SIN-LHR-SIN in two weeks time, and the system only allows me to book on the return an upgrade to F. ",1

" I wonder whose lounge SQ took over. Others in D concourse, IIRC, were JAL, Emirates, China Airlines, the extra Cathay lounge, and maybe one or two others. Did any of those close and get converted into the Silver Kris Lounge? EK and CI had the garden view.

" As far as I know, this type of early requalification still exists. In your example above, your account should be reset two months early - which is October 31st, 2008, which makes you have 14 months to requalify for the next year (your new PPS year still remains Jan 1 - Dec 31). However, in the next year, the reset will also be done only in October 31st, 2008, keeping the same PPS year (Jan 1 - Dec 31). PPS card validity is one month longer than the PPS year, according to the PPS section of SQ website. On the other question, you will be admitted into PPS Club as soon as you reach SGD25K in PPSV - no need to wait another 9 months. Hope this helps. ",1
" I was in TPR about ten days ago and was staggered at the behaviour of one of the pax in there.

On top of this he was on his phone with the volume turned up so loud you could hear him before you could see him. At first I thought it may be me thinking this was inappropriate, for anywhere never mind a business lounge like this, but I was sat past him and facing the entrance and I could see by the looks on all pax and staff that walked past him that he looked and was behaving like a ****.

" Some notes on this newish F kit: I like the design of the pouch very much. But as for the contents I wish SQ can be more innovative.

A change of contents every 3 months, and change of pouch design every 6-9 months please. They might not realize this, but small touches like this might make travelling on SQ Suites/First more interesting and keep premium passengers flying them. On a separate but somewhat related matter: Menu cover designs need to be changed more often like they did in the early 2000s. And please bring back the ticket jackets. Use environmentally friendly papers in smaller size if they want to be more responsible. Since they now have started to not rip the boarding passes maybe they can make those smaller but nicer to go with it. Rant of the day done. ",0

" jjpb3 makes some good points in the open complaint letter thread which I thought I'd discuss here to keep that thread OT: Originally posted by jjpb3 Finally, because we do fly SQ partly because it happens to serve the destinations we go to, possibly the most frequent reaction might just be to shift to a less miserly FFP. Peanuts, yes, but it means KrisFlyer doesn't get payments from my *A flights whereas the partner FFP would, including my SQ flights. More important, SQ loses a good source of customer data, as well as a touchpoint with its customers. What will peoples' reactions to this change be ? 1 Switch to another FFP. KF doesn't get payments but also doesn't end up with corresponding liabilities. For those of us (like myself) who are mainly interested in redeeming on SQ, switching to another FFP doesn't work if - as shortfinals suggests - it will not be possible at all to redeem for 77W/380 flights with miles from other FFPs. 2 Cut up and return my PPS card and never take another SQ flight if I can help it. Painful though the announced changes may be, I don't think I'm at this stage and this is precisely what SQ are counting on. 3 Reduce the number of SQ flights taken. Like jjpb3 says, SQ serve a destination I go to frequently (SIN) but given that I also like HK very much, I suppose I could do an indirect routing in future with TAir. It would probably mean not requalifying for PPS and getting *G on some other FFP (e.g. BD); or, even ditching *A status altogether, given the withdrawal of UA LHR-JFK and that out of my 70+ sectors and 100,000+ BIS miles this year, the only *A flights have been SQ, UA to JFK and other *A airlines for my SQ PPS RTW run. 4 Moan (either here on SQT or to SQ) but ultimately take the pain with no change in my flying/FFP habits. SQ wins. Unfortunately, it looks like option 4 is the most likely at the moment... ",1

" Originally posted by sudsoz View Post But I do think that if your activity is going to generate gold or other elite status then there is something to be said for doing that with an airline I am going to actually travel with from time to time.

Totally agree with that sentiment. It's a fine balancing act - generous earn/burn vs status benefits. Hence ""Which FFP?"" threads surface from time to time on here, and inspire so much passionate debate. More factors to consider when the FFP on the carrier one actually flies most often has significant benefits specific to that carrier, as opposed to general alliance wide benefits. Most of my flying is done on QF these days (by choice ) and status on QFF would bring significant benefits flying on QF, both official and unpublished. However when I took time to consider what I'd deem my fundamental priorities in an FFP (premium class award tickets, some form of lounge access and avoiding queues) vs what I'd consider nice but not essential (benefits over and above the basic alliance wide benes), the much more generous earn/burn ratio that AAdvantage offers is more than sufficient to outweigh the metaphorically bigger smile I'd get from QF as a QFF elite. I also get to fly on AA a few times a year to be able to use the AA-specific benes I'd derive from AAdvantage status, so it's not all ""wasted."" Of course this may change in the years ahead when I cease having time to use miles and instead find some of the QFF benes attractive. I considered the same thing when I flew Star, back in the good ol days of PPS sectors and I simply did the double dip with LH M&M. bmi wasn't open to people outside Europe when I joined M&M and I didn't want to bother with forwarding mail. Like you I too found it hard to work out NZ's system and also been advised that their earn/burn isn't that great anyway, though pretty easy elite status and generous perks from what I can tell. ",1

" Originally posted by stargold View Post It seems that Koreans (yes, both KE and OZ) just can't do decent lounges. Everything from OZ F lounge in the main terminal to the C lounge in the satellite are consistently underwhelming, with almost every aspect of the lounge well behind most of its competition. KE is a little better, but still far from competitive. One of the problems is that they allow too many people into the lounges through Priority Pass and Korean credit cards. It basically makes the provision of decent F&B prohibitively expensive, especially given the speed at which entire servings of hot food can disappear literally in minutes. Recently, I have started skipping ICN lounges altogether. The only exception is when/if I gain access to the KE F lounge, where I will get one of those gold/silver metallic bag tags made. Of the KE J lounges at ICN, I find the one in the main terminal to be much better even though it's obviously older. ",0

" I'm under the impression that as far as SQ awards go: * KF members have the most availability (with, I believe, PPS getting even more); * lower down, the *A FFP from a particular country has the most availability from that country, e.g. BD has the most availability ex-LHR; and * finally, all other *A FFPs share the same availability. I don't know whether the above differentiates by fare bucket or not. It may be something similar to availability depending on point of sale, i.e. the same fare bucket but availability differs depending on who makes the query. Added to the above, KF members can redeem for unrestricted awards which cost double (i.e. A380 and 77W) but this unrestricted award fare bucket is not available for other *A FFPs redemptions.

" Originally posted by Trawler View Post Hello everyone! I've not used SQ's online upgrade tool before I'd like to run my scenario by the experts here to see if what I'm planning is possible. It's a bit of an elaborate scenario as I'm trying ot maximize our Krisflyer balances, so at the top of this post I'll just state my questions, but if you want the full rundown on what I'm trying to achieve read below. If only SQ would allow points to be transferred between family members this post wouldn't be required. Say I book a flight for two people return BNE-SIN-LHR. Is it possible with the online tool to upgrade just one of those people for one either a departing or returning segment? And if this isn't possible, if we booked seperate individual flights would I be able to upgrade just the departing or returning segement of my own flight? Also, I understand that a flexi economy ticket that has been upgraded to business is flexible in terms of date changes. However can a stopover be added at a later date if one wasn't specified in the original booking? I'm not sure at all about this as stopover flights seemt to be difficult to book online, more points seem to be required if you want to upgrade a flight with individual segments and I don't want to miss out on the 15% online discount. OK now for the scenario, just in case you're wondering what on Earth I'm on about! My wife and I are planning to travel from Brisbane to London return. We would like to travel business class so am looking at upgrade scenarios from Flexi Economy using our Krisflyer points. Our balances are: Myself: ~210,000 Wife: ~100,000 Clearly we don't have enough points to cover the upgrade as it stands, so we'll have to cough up the extra at $40 per 1,000 miles. That's OK, I just want to make sure we're using our balances to best effect. Family members can upgrade other family members using point from their accounts as long as that person is in their Redemption Nominees list. (can set this up in account settings) You can do upgrades for any part off the trip, as each part will have a tick box next to it, as long as a upgrade is possible. (ticket type, still seats left, ect) Standard(SIN-LHR) upgrade from full fare economy to business costs 100,000 points according to the online calculator Be carefull of this as last time I tried to upgrade online for SIN-LHR on the A380 8 months before flight, No standard upgrades just full at 225,000 points. (Did a standard upgrade over the phone for 90,000 in the end) Wait listing can be a good idea if you don`t have too many points and are KrisFlyer gold or above. ",1

I haven't flown a CRTWSTAR or FRTWSTAR ticket for a while now so no idea if it is still the same but some of the values on one way tickets are strange. On this subject I have to say that while I can see why they went down the value route rather than PPS sectors, and indeed others are now following suit, I don't think they fully considered the implications of dropping LPP and then introducing PPSV Reserve. I was speaking to a fellow TPP SQTalker in Singapore last week who has got over 6 years worth of PPSV Reserve. As a result he has been flying CX, JL etc and keeping top tier status in OW as well.

" Originally posted by inix View Post If you have spare miles to play, it could be possible as I did something similar. I booked SIN - CDG round trip initially, only to decide eventually that I want to return from LHR last year. Tickets were available for LHR-SIN, so I ticketed THAT first (remember, I already have my SIN - CDG - SIN round trip ticket), and I called SQ to break my tickets into a 1 way SIN - CDG. Effectively, they are cancelling my round trip and reissuing it into 1 way SIN - CDG, so it was done rather painlessly. But again, I made it very clear to them what I needed, and how they can do it, so so after some questions, it was done. If it helps, I have done the same as inix quite painlessly as well. I had issued a SIN-MUC-SIN on EY and then subsequently realized there is a SIN-MUC in J available. I then called up Krisflyer, told them that i wanted to depart to MUC in J and keep the return sector in Y. The agent told me he was able to do everything for me after a 10min hold and i will get email confirmations in the same day. Effectively, he cancelled my first SIN-MUC-SIN booking and rebooked a SIN-MUC in J and return MUC-SIN in Y, email confirmation received in 3 hours. My miles were redeposited and deducted accordingly and taxes refunded in a few days. Try calling during the day. The agents i've encountered during the day are far more helpful. Hope this helps! ",1

Besides, in J, most of the star gold benefits are part of the ticket anyway. Also, I frequent CX and SQ, so AS makes a lot of sense for me. PPS is never my consideration as I need to do 100% on SQ to make PPS. The only downside is availability can be hard to find for redemption, unless booking really close in or extremely early. Also, AS does not allow redemption on SQ. So I send the CC points to KF to access SQ awards. ",1

No need to put any miles into KF as the earning ratio for flights is very weak. Better to use all the fantastic credit cards in Singapore. And watch out for loopholes.

" I've always wondered what kind of perks a PPS member gets, especially those based in Singapore. I'm not referring to travel perks like priority check-in/boarding, lounge access etc, but non-travel perks like special events etc. As a traveller who flies mainly in economy, PPS is essentially out of reach. Frequent travellers on SQ Y can qualify for Krisflyer Gold, equivalent to Star Gold, which does give you useful travel benefits on SQ and Star Alliance carriers that make frequent travel more tolerable. Which is all good, but forgive me if I still get occasional bouts of PPS envy... I was recently given a ""peek through the curtain"" of PPS benefits by my good friend, who is also a frequent traveller, and someone who, together with his globe-trotting spouse, has enjoyed the benefits of (Solitaire) PPS membership for years and years... PPS members get their own magazine, ""Priority"", a slick publication with lifestyle and travel articles... I browsed one issue recently, and it highlighted some of the events organised for PPS members during the year... ...which included a ""junior cabin crew experience"" for young members, a wine masterclass, and a flight simulator experience.

" yup, THAI retimed the initial flight with new lie-flat shell & 15"" AVOD PTV seats to 15 mins later (from 1925 to 1940hrs), and downgraded the aircraft to the one with with conventional recliner Royal Silk Class seats. I asked for the earlier flight at 1625hrs, with the new lie-flat shell & 15"" AVOD PTV seats and they reissued the ticket for me free! My main concern is the seats in the aircraft, not time of flight. New lie flat seats preferred. Got downgraded is disappointing news. ",1
" To be honest, i prefer the 744 Skysuite over the A380 Suites. But i guess if you have the potential opportunity to fly suites then it is worth it, if only to see why it really is NOT a class beyond first (more like a new first class). In the current climate i cannot see anyone of sound mind paying the premium to travel on suites. Dont get me wrong though, it is still very nice. Slighly Off topic, but i too am getting very annoyed with SQ/KF re their policy on redemptions. I was going to book a return F trip for my mother from LHR -SIN in the summer to come visit and now they have changed from 744 to 77W there is not much chance of that. Fortunately i have allready booked the first outward leg, but god knows how she is going to get back. It seems the only 744/saver option to Europe now is via FRA! I hope you get the flight you want, and if not at least a refund of miles equivalent to a saver award. ",1

" Visited the new SKL in ICN, and it's probably the best Star Alliance lounge in ICN. Quite centrally located. Once you reach the top of the escalator, you will see lots of DFS goods strewn all over the place. It's a packing and delivery zone for all DFS purchases. It's a mess, and isnt the most welcoming scene before you reach the lounge. It's the same situation for OZ's Central Business Class lounge. Fortunately, the entrance to the lounge is across an overhead bridge and away from the mess. Entrance Batik motifs on the ceiling leading to the lounge. Rest of the lounge was bright and spacious. It did get a little crowded as the evening passed, but seats remained plentiful (but this could be because the load on SQ603 was quite light that night) Food was very good and beautifully presented. Better than SKL MNL, but not as varied as LHR. Overall a much better place to relax before your flight compared to the OZ lounge. ",0

On top of this, Star Alliance carriers process FFP accruals (and bill their partners) based on the operating carrier's fare bucket. The transparency of this can be debated but partner airlines try to align things reciprocally as in principle products are supposed to be 'metal neutral' (especially when the 2 carriers operate a JV or strategic alliance) and you're not meant to be disadvantaged when booking one carrier's code over another. In reality, the complexities of airline revenue management systems and FFP processes mean gaps can and do exist... T&Cs apply etc etc ",1
" Originally posted by jambalaya View Post I am a QPP (first year) and will re-qualify for next year. Before that I've been a lowly Gold member for the past 10 years or so. I was ""gifted"" Marco Polo Diamond through my credit card, so I thgouth I'd give it a test drive (their marketing worked this time!). Since I received the Diamond benefit, I've flown CX on around 20 sectors, and am absolutely loving it. The overall experience may not be quite up to SQ standards although they do have some positives, but their treatment of premium flyers in my mind is far superior to SQ. This ranges from: - acknowledgement on board EVERY time I fly (and they are genuine about it), including a few times a little note on my seat welcoming me on board - on the 80 or so SQ sectors in the past year in Y and J I've been acknowledged and greeted perhaps 10 times - OW F lounge access in any airport - The occasional upgrade - although I never expect this, so not as big a deal but still nice. Given qualifying for diamond is no where near as onerous as a QPP (let alone TPP) for me since I don't always fly J or F, this in itself is a huge differentiator. Oh and to top it off, when submitting an expense claim for misplaced baggage with SQ, I was always addressed with a completely different first name in written communications - so much for ""highly personalised"" service as a QPP. Anyway, to the point of my post - based on the above I'm ready to switch to CX full time, and fly SQ only when required (still more convenient for SE Asia connections). Is it worthwhile me providing the above feedback to SQ and tell them I'm leaving? I don't necessarily want anything from them; my mind is made up, but I would hope that feedback in this business is something they take seriously and hopefully act upon. Sorry, I have a silly question. Which credit cards are gifting marco polo diamond statuses ? It looks very tempting to try cx indeed ! ",1

" Originally posted by SQveteran View Post Yes, sorry, that is correct. The point i didn't make very well was NZ in a bold move simply dumped their miles metric altogether and replaced it with an 'Airpoint Dollar'. The dollars earned are indeed set by the airline, based on their own internal working that reflects the value of any sector. Once credited to a member account, the Airpoint Dollars are as good as cash to 'buy' any flight for which you have enough Airpoint Dollars. Since Airpoint Dollars are tabled this scheme unlike SQ's is fully transparent. If you check the table carefully you will see there is a causal link between revenue and Airpoint dollars awarded. I also understand that Virgin Blue have a more SQ like program where awarded credits are directly linked to actual purchase price in their Velocity programme. The big negative of NZ scheme is that it makes premium award ticket much more expensive than Y as far as I understand the program since it goes by paid fares (at least on NZ). The advantage is that if a seat is there, you get it. ",1

" Originally posted by tfung View Post yeah.. of course.. but would you rather be a devalued PPS member or just a regular KF member? haha... CX has Diamond Plus, UA has UGS, BA has Premier.. sure, PPS might be devalued, but then it gives SQ what it wants without upsetting existing members too much.. a defined high revenue customer group, where they can spend their resources on.. not just the ones who travel a lot.. I would prefer this option rather than SQ just saying $25k cut off, and anyone below that gets downgraded to KF. UA GS is not totally based on revenue. One can be nominated to UGS without spending. United Sales gives the status as corporate incentives. EMC is one such company whose Travel Managers receives a set number annually to be given to EMC Executives and Top Management. Many 1K had written United pointing out 1K can only be earned by spending & UGS can be earned without spending and made their displeasure known being downgraded .Thus UA in 2007 is making effort to elevate the 1K status.

" Originally posted by SQ228 View Post What would SQ do though if you have a redemption flight and due to air traffic problems, you were delayed and missed it? I could always book the later flight I guess and give myself a 10 hour connection. Anything under 24 hours where I don't leave the airport is allowable without a visa provided I show them my onward connection. ? Are you referring to single ticket redemption or 2 separate tickets. Since you are on fairly linear route via PEK, I really encourage you to book a 6-segment RT ticket and don't complicate things. Whichever is allowed by the system will be fine even if the connection time is tight. Experience: I just missed a connection in Warsaw last week on a minimum 40 min connection. LOT to LOT award flight issued by SQ. They rebooked me on an alternative routing with no fuss with SAS. I saw my fellow passengers got offered an Air France routing even. If you miss such connection, they will find some way out. So even if you miss CA's flight to TSE, they will have to accommodate you on other airlines flights or put you in hotel room. Since it's unlikely they will put you 4 days later, they can put you on Air Astana or route via Urumqi, Seoul etc. They will have to. I have missed connections before too on redemption flights. Same case, no sweat, got rerouted, sometimes even on revenue fare class and I earned miles out of it! Just relax and reap the insurance benefits also if the delay is Long. Book single ticket and just relax is my advice. ",1

I much prefer airport lounges with a view too. I normally just treat the SQ HK lounge as a pitstop. I am in there for the least possible time, just for food and drinks, before I head outside again.

" Originally posted by Kyo View Post Why, isn't it going to be tasty? I don't do pork anyway... plus, it's an F request... shouldn't that have a reasonable chance of something good? Actually no. Kosher meals are set up that way. The portions might be slightly larger .. but everything will still be in plastic, wrapped in foil and disposable. Larger portions only on what is 'standard' . It will not be based on what SQ will spend on a special meal. Or maybe not even. Sometimes you just get what is given, as a TV dinner. Maybe you might get two economy class servings instead of one as a F class passenger. You will not be allowed to use the normal cutlery, and the food cannot be placed on the lovely SQ china. You just have to sit there and eat what's given to you. Oh ya, you break the seal first. Otherwise that won't be kosher then, will it now? KSML is based on religious standards. KSML does not mix dairy and meat together. No shellfish. Everything according to strict kosher standards. It will be easier if you just specify that you don't want pork. But as a F class passenger, you may just pick and choose what you want or don't want to eat. ",0

From the LH USA site, the mileage requirements for the tiers is a bit different (lower), but this page is much more informative. Originally posted by CGK View Post Hi HUGE AL. Welcome to SQTalk. You have mentioned about the reason as for ""mileage upgrade possibility."" The one other factor is the location of the person, as well as the most usual pattern of the travel. For example, since you mention she always pays in C or F, if the routing she usually flown is only 2-class service, ""mileage upgrade possibility"" would not really beneficial; unless she buys Y tix. CGK, thanks for the reply...AWESOME (though I'm still curious as to what you do that allows you to travel ATW so much...)! She's in LAX and her travel patterns are pretty much the same as this itinerary. She'll usually either go East or West, but more often than not, she'll pretty much match this route. Sorry, what I meant was: if she's in C and there's an F available, that's when she'll trigger her mileage usage. If it's only a 2-class (or an upgrade is not available), she'll sit in her paid C seat and (she's said this many times) give her miles to her friends. I've never seen so much FFP...um...what's a nice way to put this...lack of caring/knowledge...

I am pleased to know SQ listened to the customers about the card designs. The cards and tags now look much better: - As mentioned before, the ""KRISFLYER SINGAPORE AIRLINES PPS CLUB SOLITAIRE"" are now in white color (with slight shadowing effect) which made it easier to read and they are 'built into' the card image, rather than 'added on' like previously. I am pretty sure this one will be durable. - Years Qualified is back. - SQ logo is now in real metallic (gold) compared to 'gold image' previously (seems like for QPP it is 'real silver metallic' as opposed to 'silver image' previously). - Star Alliance Gold logo is slightly enlarged. - TPP tags are now in gold, differentiated from QPP tags (silverish/pink). - New kebaya patterns on the tags to match the cards. - The new cover is very well designed, the best one I have seen so far.

" Frankly, I'm ambivalent to this subject. Any business dealing with thousands of retail customers each day will undoubtedly attract a handful of ""PITA"" individuals. I feel sorry if crew occasionally have to deal with rudeness, but this is the nature of the job.

" hi Dukesy, I think the easiest way would be to book your C ticket seperate from your wife and infant ticket. I'm not sure of availability of online upgrade redemptions if you book through a travel agent. As far as i remember you can't access your booking online if you book through a travel agent so therefore you would not be able to redeem the 50% off miles upgrade. Your C ticket can be purchased at an agent though, as there will be no need for online redemption. Please also note that when upgrading your wife's ticket, that these deals on miles are only good for travel until end Sept 09. Travel in Feb would not qualify. After Sept, it will revert to 15% off unless they come up with a new promo. Anyone else care to add anything i may have missed? ",1

Any update on either lounge (or any other I've missed) since the last post was two years ago? Thanks in advance! We tried 3 *A lounges prior to departing on SQ238 earlier this month. Of the 3, NZ is still my favourite of the lot. 1) SKL - hasn't changed. still small, cramped with rather glaring lights. Never mind the lack of natural lighting or tarmac views, but they have some sort of fittings on the few windows they had in the lounge. It's been a while since I've used the showers here but from the last time I used them, I recall that they had some decent showers. OK selection of F&B. Also, whilst it didn't affect me, the other half had a headache from some sort of scent or pollen emitted by plant/s installed in the SKL. 2) UA RCC - much airier than the SKL with more natural lighting. We were only in there for a little while (to bide our time whilst waiting for the NZ lounge to open) so didn't check out the food/drink selection, but it looked as though the SKL had a better drinks' selection. lounge staff here were v welcoming and even made sure that we knew where/when the SQ flight was departing. 3) NZ - we were the only people in there as the next NZ departure was a fair while away. it does get crowded during NZ departures and especially in the late arvo when TG pax arrive (but so does the SKL prior to SQ flights). lots of natural lighting, tarmac views, and the best selection of F&B. very soothing decor and comfy furniture - refer to the pics as the lounge hasn't changed much. the lounge dragon let us in without a fight this time, but wasn't v nice in doing so.

 Not enough information but unfortunately they are right.

Elite miles counter is reset at the start of every qualification year - this qualification year does not tie in with the calendar year. ,1

" My 2006 Trip Recap This year is certainly a different year for me personally as well as flying-wise. Trying different airlines, and yes, the infamous CGK Flying Economy as well as trying the new Business Class and First Class seats on SQ 77W. And not to forget that I tried the new Business Class seat on NZ and loved it. This is was the first time ever I visited India, southern part of India precisely. First time on JetAirways and AirSrilankan. And to honor Traitors Air follower here in SQT, I did take one flight on CX F BKK-SIN. The summary of my travels is gathered from the flight logs that I did on ba97. Well more or less accurate ( of course there were secret flights taken and not logged). This year I have taken 157 flight segments: - 7 segments in Y - 52 segments in C - 98 segments in F The total actual miles I have flown is 394,863 miles: - 3,422 miles in Y - 109,664 miles in C - 281,777 miles in F As you can guess, most of my flights would be on SQ. But I know I have reduced it a bit like instead of taking SQ12 NRT-LAX I was taking NH for the sake of the best kyo-kaiseki and that wagyu beef salad (but overall flight experience is still not SQ). And of course followed by LH and UA as they are my main FF programs. I am pretty satisfied that I have requalified for my UA-1K for another year, as well as LH SEN. No HON status for me because my LH only status miles are very low. - SQ 78 flights - UA 26 - LH 18 And from 78 flights on SQ only, I was in F 62 of them, C 15, and Y 1 (the only one that created a chaos at SKL desk ) Well, I have logged 226,945 miles on SQ with this breakdown: - Y 1,708 - C 41,707 - F 183,530 As you can see, 80% of my SQ flights were in F. This percentage is lower compare to DeltaFlyingProf which is hoovering around 88%. Thus, it's a valid reason for me to call him Mr. F.

" Originally posted by geoffb78 View Post Hi all I've started detailed planning for a Star Alliance round the world business class award (departing September 2017) using KrisFlyer points. I called KF recently and was advised that I need to book all the segments required to meet the 'around the world' requirement/condition at one time. However, I called again yesterday and managed to snare the seats I needed for the first outbound leg (with SQ), which the operator appears to have reserved for me until a ticketing deadline in July 2017. Now that I've gotten this far, I don't want to miss out on award seats for subsequent legs because I am waiting for award seats to open up on the even later legs. I'm also keen to see if I can avoid the US$20 fee per change per ticket (there are two of us travelling). Does anyone have any advice? I could probably book a set of earlier 'dummy' dates and then call to change the dates once award seats for my actual preferred date of travel are released but that could get expensive. Also if anyone understands the backtracking rules, I'd value advice on that. The KF call centre operator was lovely but I couldn't get an answer to my question about whether flying YVR-xYYZ-SIN constituted backtracking in an itinerary that looks like BNE-xSIN-BKK-ICN-FRA-MIA or MCO-YVR-xYYZ-xSIN-BNE. Any other routing suggestions for getting back to Oz from the west (or east) coast of the US/Canada? Finally, the KF operator advised that even date changes are not permitted after departure. Does this sound right? Thanks in advance. Geoff. I just booked such a ticket, but as revenue fare in Y, not redemption in J (April 2017). I couldn't be bothered with the hassle of dealing with AC, NZ or VA to get me back home from the west coast and UA is a no-go, so I just popped SFO-MEL into the multi-city search on the SQ website. Routed me quite happily on the new non-stop SFO-SIN then onto a flight to MEL. My routing is MEL-SIN-DUS//FRA-JFK//SFO-SIN-MEL. No problem getting it to be recognised as round-the-world and I was quite happy with the price. Between JFK and SFO I haven't finalised my exact plans, but will just use short flights on AC or UA so my Elite Gold is recognised for luggage etc. I have no idea about date change rules I'm afraid though.

" Originally posted by d_exmen View Post Yep. My company bought SQ flight # SQ 001/002 economy class from SFO - SIN. When I checked in and gave my Krisflyer number, she told me that the fare was deeply discounted so I can not get any mileage. Like I said with UA MP, even if it's a deep discounted fare, I still get 100% miles plus 100% more for being 1K member. I fly to TPE, SIN, and SGN at least once every 2-3 weeks. If the paid flight in SQ Y earns no KF miles, it's because the booking class was V, G, Q, N or T. No partner mileage program will award miles for that flight because SQ will not buy the miles from the FFP. The 100% bonus for 1K's is irrelevant, because the flights you cited (SQ1/2) are operated and marketed by SQ, not UA. For those particular flights (i.e., deep discount SQ Y), there is no difference between KF and MP. As pointed out by taipeiflyer, you only forgo the 1K bonus if you were considering banking with KF when flying on UA -- but it's not true that you forgo the base mileage, because KF does give miles on UA's discount Y classes.

I have re-qualified for Solitaire PPS Club membership based on the old PPS Miles or PPS sector criteria before 1 Sept 2007 in my current membership year. How do I know if indeed my membership will be renewed for another year? All you need to do is log in at My Account and click on Statements. The row marked Additional PPS Value required for Solitaire PPS Club requalification should not appear in your statement. What is the Current PPS Club membership valid until Date? The PPS Club membership period (for all tiers) is for 12 months, and the count for renewal of membership starts from the 1st full month from qualification or upgrade. For example, if you qualify on 14 October 2007, your PPS Club membership will start immediately. However, the count for renewal will for 12 months starting from 1 November 2007; your current membership year will be valid to 31 October 2008. The same principle applies for an upgrade of tier. Upgrade takes effect immediately and a new membership period/year begins. For example, if your current PPS Club membership expiry date is 31 October 2009, but you qualified for Solitaire membership in July 2009, your new PPS qualification expiry date will be 31 Jul 2010. Why is the expiry date on my membership card different from my membership expiry date when I check my account online? A PPS Club membership period is for 12 months and that is reflected in your account statement. The expiry date on your membership card is 1 month after the end of your membership period so that you will not be inconvenienced by holding an expired card before a new one is received. You will continue to enjoy the privileges of PPS Club membership for 1 month after the end of your current membership period/year. http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...ps_member.jsp? ",1

If you want to order a BTC for the main dish AND a special meal (e.g. VLML) for the other courses, you have to ask the agent to input the special meal code plus the BTC code. Some agents will tell you that it's not possible. You just have to tell them that it is possible to enter both requests. If they don't know how to do it, their supervisor should. ",0

NH is probably the best...and they cook the raw meat to order. Counting the upcoming SQ flights, this is going to by my fourth transpacific crossing on a non-US flag carrier (I have made many Transpac crossings on CO, NW). My mind is boggled by the idea of the raw meat being prepared in-flight from its raw state. I know that CO's cooking procedure for most red meat dishes calls for barely cooking the meat in the flight kitchen and then cooking it the rest of the way in-flight to try and ensure that each and every piece comes out medium to medium well. In the real world, this process works fairly ex-CO hubs where CO owns their own flight kitchens, but is far more hit or miss at their outstations where they do not own their flight kitchens and therefore lack the oversight to ensure that each and every procedure is adhered to 100%. Ex-CO hubs I am to exploit this procedure by requesting the FA (in the nicest way possible, generally, this requires a bribe of chocolates or some other form of food) to cook my piece of red meat for far less time than the the instructions call for. The outcome, a piece of red meat that is medium rare to even rare (on some RARE occasions).

" Originally posted by milehighj View Post Looks like the overall global and domestic outlook continues to remain bleak, guys. Selecting big redemption discounts and courtesy requalification are all nice, but borne out of necessity rather than a new well-spring of goodwill. Nice appetizers of humble pie. And now it's time for the main course, SQ: Time to rescind the ridiculous PPS Value system!! Bring back LPP and the real QPP/TPP benefits!! After all, anyone who flies paid longhaul F or J 2-4 times a year should rightfully earn top tier (QPP/TPP) status - but given all these discounted fares this may not happen! And guess what, your competitors have got a clue... Think about it carefully chaps. Customer loyalty should definitely be worth a few percentage points of F & J load factor these days, and boy do you guys need it!! Disagree. PPS Value is actually a decision I strongly support. From an airline point of view, you want to pamper those customers who make the most money - showing up 200 times for the cheapest eco fare on SIN-BKK and then expect special treatment... Why? Another reason is that qualification by miles is a very variable income: In times where fares are high, SQ makes a lot of money - with the current promos, making it to PPS would be only half the revenue for them. While this decision made sense, the whole culling of benefits was wrong. And SQ is seeing that at the moment: People are not loyal to an airline that is not appreciating their business. PPS is a mediocre tier: I can check in at the Business Class counter (hey, I am holding already tickets in at least J otherwise I would have never made it to PPS) and access to the KrisFlyer Lounge is not allowed if you are not holding at least a J ticket....

" I'm thinking of going somewhere over the long Vesak Day weekend (27-30th May) and was wondering if anyone here had any suggestions? Ex-SIN of course. Am using KF miles so will have to be within the SQ routemap. As I'm on a short leash of time, flight should probably not take too long either. Preferably city environment, since I'm looking at a chill urban environment.

" I do agree that 'god-like treatment' came from an unattributed source and is dodgy for that reason. For all we know it could have been a complete fabrication of the newspaper that printed the quote. However do note that SQ has never attempted to put out anything to the contrary. SQ has, however, bandied around the term 'more exclusivity' and has on multiple occasions alluded to a higher level of service for members of the new PPS Club, when no evidence of this has been presented I can't speak for everyone else but I used the term 'god like treatment' as a form of irony. It is safe to say that SQ has failed in the PR stakes, for reasons already listed by other posters, and in a strange way the quote, albeit of a dubious source, epitomises the poor media handling we've seen so far simply because it is perhaps one of the most memorable quotes (in a 'yeah, right - NOT!' kind of way) I've ever read and thus the most worthy of parody. Now things would have been different of course if SQ had at least attempted to downplay the quote or released actual evidence of better service to match its rhetoric. 'More exclusivity' ought to come 2nd place for comedic value ... and this actually came straight from the airline's own releases. ",1

" Hi, There have been many topics in the past regarding the same however I am unaware if the system has changed over the years. Every summer I do a J/F saver redemption trip to the US, ORD in particular. I usually call KF up, ask them for SIN-FRA-ORD on LH or SIN-ICN-ORD on OZ. In most cases in the last few years these have been unavailable for whatever reason along with several other one stop options. Last summer I ended up with the following: SIN-BKK-LAX-ORD-JFK-FRA-SIN with the latter two segments on the SQ 747. Availability on UA through NRT and HKG was also not offered. This year I was put on SIN-ICN (SQ) ICN-ORD (OZ) and ORD-ICN-PEK-SIN on CA and SQ. Personally I find this a maddening itinerary. I feel like I'm missing something in regards to *A availability with many flights unavailable despite many visits to the ION office.

Depending on the balance miles required for one to attain gold, sometime you may contact SIA to upgrade you first as a special request.

" Originally posted by Airtropolis View Post I guess its a combination of factors: 1) Loads in the premium cabins are indeed up. 2) The Silver Kris lounge now has to accomodate Stargolds; Business Class pax from Partner airlines as well as First Class pax in what is essentially only the Business class lounge. 3) More worrisome though - SQ's operations used to be divided between T2 and T3 with a separate Silver Kris lounge complex, serving each terminal, so its likely a capacity decrease (even more so if you read this article - https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/bru...remium-lounges, which says that though the upcoming T3 SK Lounge complex is larger in size by 30% compared to the former and can accomodate over 1000pax at a go ... the same article states that the current Qantas First + Business class lounges can accomodate 800 over pax ... which for a non Singapore based carrier is generous especially compared to the 1000+ pax capacity of the upcoming SK Lounges in T3 in total!) The above illustrates how limited in capacity the upcoming SK lounges actually are - unless there are plans for another SK Lounge complex in T2 or maybe even T1... now that SQ's operations are divided in these two terminals. SQ passenger capacity is already up to nearly 50% of pre-COVID times so it shouldn't be too much longer before they branch back out to T2, which is currently still closed. This will take some burden off this new lounge. Secondly, *G entry for those flying in the tail is temporary until a new KF Lounge is ready but 9V-JKL's report says that's still a year away, if completed on time. *G flying Premium/Economy is a large number, especially regionally. It's busier than I expected for current traffic and it won't get better anytime soon, actually getting worse as passenger loads continue to improve. The first change to help, is whether there is a schedule to open T2 but really, SQ don't care about whether the lounge is busy if they can save costs by currently consolidating in a single terminal. SQ have a deal with other lounger to share space - when I headed to Europe back in November, SQ already signed me into the SATS lounge next door as the temp SQ lounge was already packed....... this, then meant SATS lounge was also already super busy.

" To sum up my current impression of this lounge: it is a decent lounge, with good F&B options. It is great that the showers have been refurbished too. Proximity to the boarding gates were a plus as well. The main negative for me is that it is (still) a windowless lounge in an airport where so many other lounges have wonderful views, open airy atriums, and great ambience. There are at least 2 other lounges in HKG available to Krisflyer Gold/PPS/Star Alliance Gold members: the United Lounge and Thai Airways Lounge, both of which are larger and offer better ambience in large, open spaces (Although UA catering was quite minimal compared to SQ). However, these other lounges are located quite far from the SQ gates, which would make it quite inconvenient to visit if you were short of time. As mentioned in the past, I would visit this lounge for a quick snack and a drink, and maybe a shower, before heading out to enjoy the shopping and ambience outside. Not a lounge I would want to spend a lot of time in, given how wonderful the HKG airside area is. ",0

In either case, your balance of RDM's and EQM's on TG can't be transferred to SQ unless it was very recent (we're talking several days here) and you can prove that you had intended to credit those flights to SQ but a computer glitch or agent put it into TG instead.

" Originally posted by SQ380 View Post This meant that SIA needed to re-examine its pricing model with SATS, and the costs involved to ensure that the ground handler could commit to having suficient resources being scheduled to handle the crowds at check-in (surge or no surge). Clearly, the responses from SATS was disappointing and not up to my expectations. The sudden surge explanation was theoretical nonsense; and the upcoming school holiday ""assurance"" proved inadequate. I further reiterated that the ""Priority"" lane, not being made available to Star Alliance / Krisflyer Elite Gold passengers was also a joke. Singapore Airlines was the only Star Alliance partner airline that was not keeping to the ""Priority Boarding"" pledge. Two Points...... First, I arrived T3 around 7:45am for my 9:30am flight to HKG on Monday, the first working day of the school holiday. It took me more than half an hour to check in, with the *A/KFG queue extending beyond the tapes when I arrived. I was, however, lucky I didn't arrive 10-15min later because the queue extended out of the main isle and into the main thoroughfare of T3 entrance quite significantly. At current speeds, check-in would have taken more than an hour and probably much longer but I was nearly through and don't know how SQ responded. My wife, who had arrived with me for her 10:15am Jet* flight to HKG was checked-in, through immigration and waiting for me at T1 before I was even half way through my KFG queue. She was through T1 ~20min after arrival at T3 (inc. travel between terminals) and had paid a fraction of the price for her ticket. Since I was flying 'with' but without my wife we took a common taxi to T3 but I couldn't use JetQuay.......and I was pained that this morning was bad enough to make we actually wish I had. Ah well, next visit via JetQuay for sure. With regards Priority Boarding, and whilst I agree with you to some extent, I normally leave the lounge a little late and make sure to arrive at the gate during boarding. The J boarding queue is usually gone quite quickly after opening, if there is one, and I will use that entrance so long as there's not too many people, ie. waiting until J passengers have boarded. The Y queue by this time is usually a snake so the counter have always taken me through. As a frequent Y passenger on SQ and infrequent J passenger of SQ and other *A members I can see both sides of SQ's plan, but it simply doesn't work in practise. ",1

" Originally posted by sqlove View Post Hi JJPB3, thanks for sharing. So does that mean I need 50k more elite miles, or 25k? of which I currently have none. I dont know though, if prior to my hitting silver, I had any elite miles or not? how do you suppose i can check? if what you're saying works out, then does that mean I need only 25k elite miles to hit EG? I guess i will have a clearer picture by Oct after I do SFO-SIN, and another SIN-SFO-SIN; thereafter I will call KF to enquire about my status. Thanks. You had to have had elite miles before hitting ES (at least 25,000 of them ). The least generous scenario has you hitting ES on the outbound leg of your second SIN-SFO-SIN trip (I assume by 'a couple', you meant at least two in post #78).

" Originally posted by UMD View Post I normally do not like the crew to offer me the usual ""let me know if you need anything else"" tag line because I may be disappointed if my expectation is not met later.

However, when I asked for a cup of Japanese green tea instead of a full meal later during the flight to one of the flight attendants, I was told it was not available for a Y pax after she had tried to get it for me from the front cabin galley. Wow. That's the scenario I'm concerned about (I'd been tempted to ask for one of the proper coffees from the front cabin). Originally posted by UMD View Post Well, you'd better do it faster. SQ is removing TWG teas from the air faster than one can say ""fast"". There are now only 10 blends of TWG tea onboard and only about 4 of them agree with my taste bud. They are English Breakfast Tea, Earl Grey, Singapore Breakfast Tea, and Chamomile. I wonder if their relationship with TWG is going through difficulties. I hear TWG is persnickety about their teas and the conditions under which they are served. I'm not a fan of the English Breakfast blend; there are better (to my palate) blends in Waitrose. I'm with you and Kyo about the Singapore Breakfast tea -- it has become my morning picker-upper, even overtaking my up-to-now favored matcha tea. ",1

" CGK's point was the reason I had suggested SE Asian destinations: you can do a turnaround or short hop. I've consistently found that adding, say, BKK or DPS adds very little money to LHR-SIN-LHR. If you do LHR-SIN-BKK or DPS return, for example, you'll get the 19,000 miles because of your EG bonus. It's doable over a long weekend,and this is one of the two times of the year (the other is spring) when the LHR-SE Asia fares are very reasonable. Originally posted by CGK View Post Well, having so much fun in Singapore, would be nice. And if you like to go shopping, perhaps that fares will make up for how expensive UK is.

" 24 April 2009 Braised abalone with pickled cucumber Wakame seaweed soup with scallop and dried oyster Braised lamb with red dates and daikon Warm eight treasure rice with strawberry ice cream and caramel sauce These are just a sampling of the many mouth-watering creations, that will soon be tantalizing the palates of Singapore Airlines customers. From 1 May, these choices will be part of a range of new dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美) making its debut in the First Class cabins onboard Singapore Airlines flights departing from Beijing and Shanghai. Exclusive to Singapore Airlines, Shi Quan Shi Mei was conceptualised as a presentation of the richness and diversity of Chinese culinary heritage. First introduced in 2005, the latest choices for this popular inflight Chinese fine dining experience are the creations of award-winning Chinese chef Zhu Jun (朱俊), the newest member of the International Culinary Panel. Winner of Excellent Chef at the 15th China Chef Festival, Chef Zhu is currently the Vice General Manager and Executive Chef of Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering, one of Chinas leading restaurant chains, and an icon synonymous with elegance, quality and service excellence. Shi Quan Shi Mei will be presented as an elegant spread of specially created Chinese delicacies, including appetizers, a double-boiled soup, four entrees, and dessert. Customers can look forward to savouring these new dishes, which carry Chef Zhus signature Shanghainese touch, with clear notes of provincial influences. Well known for his innovative approach to the creation and development of new dishes, Chef Zhu has also taken several classic ingredients and transformed them into dishes that will leave customers impressed by the versatility of modern Chinese cuisine. When designing and conceptualising the individual dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei, I sought to keep true to age-old Chinese culinary traditions, while also adopting a philosophy that emphasizes the use of the freshest produce. The choices we will be presenting all involve the regions choice seasonal ingredients, said Chef Zhu. He added: I am happy that Singapore Airlines has given me this opportunity, to showcase to the world, the remarkable new developments in Chinese cuisine. I hope that Singapore Airlines customers will like the new choices in the Shi Quan Shi Mei lineup, and I look forward to creating even more dishes for their enjoyment. The new dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei will be available on the First Class cabin of flights departing from Beijing and Shanghai. Customers onboard flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, and San Francisco (via Hong Kong) will continue to enjoy popular dishes designed by Singapores very own Sam Leong, another world-class chef on the International Culinary Panel, whose creations regularly grace Shi Quan Shi Mei menus. About the International Culinary Panel Since its inception in 1998, the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel continually pushed the envelope, in redefining inflight dining on Singapore Airlines. Tasked with satisfying the demands of an increasingly sophisticated traveller, the Panel has evolved over the years to reflect the diversity of excellent cuisine around the world as well as to demonstrate the Airline's commitment to offering the finest inflight dining experience to its customers. The Panel works closely with the Airlines own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available on board. Members on the Panel include Georges Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States); Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom); and Zhu Jun (China). Note to editors: New dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei, designed by Zhu Jun Appetisers * Smoked fish with special sauce * Stuffed lotus root with rice & pickled carrot * Salad of chicken and jellyfish with cucumber * Marinated spinach leaf with tuna * Braised gluten with peanut and tiger lily bud * Sweet and sour baby spare ribs * Braised abalone with pickled cucumber Double-boiled soups * Doubled boiled soup with pine mushroom * Wakame seaweed soup with scallop and dried oyster Entrees (served with steam rice) * Braised pork with red rice marinate * Stirfried sliced beef fillet with dried chilli * Steamed prawn in minced spinach sauce * Broccoli-cauliflower with bacon bits * Steamed cod with minced spinach sauce and fried oba leaves * Braised lamb with red dates and daikon * Stirfried sliced chicken in red rice sauce * Quick-fried kai lan with seasonal mushroom Desserts * Warm eight treasure rice with strawberry ice cream and caramel sauce * Steamed local pear with hashima and ice cream From SIA website: http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacen...ws/NE_2709.jsp ",0

" Originally posted by SilverChris View Post The menu varies depending on the destination. As for your second question, I didn't quite get you. Care to explain? Last year on a flight from Singapore to London, they served the dish ""Bubble and Squeak"". That's a typical English meal. I think if you serve this meal on a flight to Paris or Zurich nobody would order this meal because it's too strange and too unknown for French, Swiss or other people. So, I think they adjust to every country. Probably that's why they serve different food on every route. ",0

" http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-...ry_738004.html The Straits Times www.straitstimes.comPublished on Nov 25, 2011 The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals By Myra Martin As Singapore Airlines' (SIA) manager of Inflight Services, Mr Hermann Freidanck spearheads the creation of 1,450 different dishes every four months and hones the balance between advance cooking and reheating of meals on board an aeroplane, while also anticipating the drying effects of cabin air which affects people's taste buds. No stone is left unturned, right down to the compartmentalised aluminium foil packaging of each dish before it is presented to a passenger on board. In short, Mr Freidanck scrutinises all aspects of food and beverage served on board all of SIA's flights. Even if one passenger is allergic to aluminium foil, as he received an outstanding special request recently, he personally will ensure that a suitable alternative packaging is given instead. He has been doing this and more at SIA, for the last 13 years. What distinguishes this 58-year-old German is his knowledge, expertise, systematic delegation, foresight, gumption and a career in hotel management spanning two decades, most of which was spent in Asia. That background helps him ensure quality inflight meals that meet the expectations of SIA's clientele, usually comprising 60 per cent foreigners and 40 per cent locals - which makes for a broad spectrum of tastes. Mr Freidanck said that 'everyone is contentious when it comes to specific ideas of how certain dishes should taste' because essentially, as he quipped so succinctly, 'my grandmother does a better char kway teow than yours'. He oversees not just the overall production of meals in Singapore, but also the 53 other catering stations in destinations across 63 cities. ",0
" So here's the situation - have booked a trip for my parents (2xJ) from FCO-SIN-PER. Currently, the flight from FCO gets into SIN around 6am and the only available saver departure at the time was at 0015 the next day so they basically have about 18 hours in SIN. Just got an email yesterday informing me that the SIN-PER leg has been rescheduled about 30 mins earlier so I thought I'd take the opportunity to see if there was any availability for an earlier flight by checking the SIN-PER legs on the website. I can see availability for 2 x J savers for SQ 213 at 0740 and SQ 223 at 0930 so I thought I'd ask the KF consultant to switch them to one of these instead so that they don't have to wait so long for their next flight. I was told that he can't see the availability because the number of saver awards for transit vs for one-way flights is different so we are unable to change. Has anyone encountered this before? I highly doubt that someone else has taken the quota of transit seats for this leg as I booked this back in September last year for June this year. Or should I just ring back and hope for a ""better"" consultant? ",1

" Originally posted by yflyer View Post Hi SQ228! When I travel with the spouse (i.e. Mrs yflyer) on SQ, she is often on a different PNR as a non-FF pax. As long as she is together with me at time of check-in or boarding, I've had no issue with checking in together with her at the priority check in counters for Gold / Business. All our luggage is tagged with priority tags too. Similarly at the boarding date, we pre-board together as well. We've not had issues doing this on SQ, or even on Star Alliance partners including UA in North America. This same approach has worked when I travel as the only KFEG in a family party where the others are non-FF status. Not sure how this will play out if there is a specific express pass required to access priority immigration (In Australia, for example), but there is no harm asking if they will give you an extra express pass (Or maybe all you need is one pass for the whole party. Not sure about that part.). As KFEG/*G you can also guest another member into the lounge as long as he/she is also flying SQ the same day (No requirement to be on the same PNR.) As far as online seat selection is concerned, it is best to combine the PNRs into a single res, and check-in online together, or select all seats together, as non status pax on SQ see fewer open seats than KFEG/PPS on the online system. You may need to wait till 96 hrs before flight time to select seats online, as more seats open up for selection around that time. Just as a data point to confirm what yflyer has said. I'm QPPS, and I usually travel alone for work. Partner is statusless. He sometimes comes along when I am on a business trip, in which case I'd usually redeem a seat in J/Y for him. Preferred seat selection (discussed elsewhere: e.g. ability to pick first few rows in Y, see the seat map prior to T-96, etc) is not available for him unless I am under the same PNR, even though the miles came from my account. Ringing the call centre to override this doesn't always work -- they will make nice noises but usually nothing is or can be done. SQ does honour things like priority waitlist clearing, though, especially if I am on a paid reservation on the same flight. So the transfer of privileges is inconsistent at best. But other things that involve face-to-face interaction, like priority check in and baggage tags, work ok. If you ask nicely, the onboard crew will provide express passes. ",1

" Hi everyone, I thought some of you might be interested to learn a bit more about the decision-making process that led to SIA's recent changes to the PPS Club. A very reliable source has shared with me an internal memo that outlines the company's new approach to ""loyalty marketing"". Some notable highlights are: The new qualification rules are expected to decrease the QPP and TPP population (currently at more than 45 000) by nearly 50%. Krisshop vouchers and birthday gifts for annual requalification were eliminated to help save the airline more than $5 million annually. Overall, with lower servicing costs due to cuts in benefits as well as the smaller number of PPS members, savings are projected to be between $15 and 20 million per year. Following the April announcement, SIA anticipated a sustained negative response from existing PPS Club members. It has hired additional staff and has formed a team (as the airline puts it) to communicate ""transparent and positive"" messages. ",1

I was simply saying that without showers for Star Golds in Y, the transit experience at Singapore Airlines (who think themselves to be an elite airline of the world) is absolute rubbish. As a 'elite gold' member one would expect to be treated with a little more respect and you certainly do get that with other airlines at their main hub. As for the TG lounge in SIN, I wouldn't expect a shower there as the only destination is BKK and it is merely 2 hours away so one could grab a shower during the transit in BKK. It is not a TG hub so doesn't matter. Flying QF in Y as a Qantas Gold or Platinum I can shower in any of the Australia-Europe connection points: SIN, BKK and HKG. Why can't SQ offer that? ",0

" Thanks Al! What prompted the question is my own experience. I flew ANA to IAD/JFK last Dec. 4Y earned enough points for almost 2 SIN-NRT (low peak) return. I remembered calculating for KF, it is not possible. What made it great is that ANA has a family account where points can be pooled. So infrequent flyers will not see their points go up in smoke. Coupled with their decent Y offering (not that it matters to most who have never seen much of the back), I was lucky to get a bulkhead seating as I had my tickets issued in Jul. (No amount of luck would have gotten a KF Blue a bulkhead then, although lately, USD50 will buy me more than the luck needed) Service is good, very close to SQ's. Plus their departure timing, connecting flight timing and arrival for both ways is pretty good. NRT is nice. I paid $2200+ while SQ was already asking for $3100 at the time of booking. But I think ANA has cottoned onto SQ's surcharge alchemy and their tickets are now kind of ex but there time you can catch them at a decent price. For future flights to both sides of the US, I'd opt for ANA anytime if SQ's decides on insane pricing and for movie buffs like me, KrisWorld does not matter, I'd have seen all that is on offer. But SQ in J & F as I have found out is another matter altogether. Residing in SQ's home base makes it difficult to pick something else. ",1

" I would like to thank everyone on the interesting debate on how to accumulate Krisflyer points. There are clearly some entrepreneurial and creative people amongst us. It is easy to collect points from business partners, credit cards usage, car/hotel partner programs and from employees etc. The purpose of my question was to consider the most effective way of using Krisflyer Points and secondary whether it is a good idea to ""disrupt"" the airline business model. It seems that the best value for money from any frequent user program is to be to use the points earned on the product of the specific program. The Krisflyer program seems to be skewed to promote the point end (business first) product. Notwithstanding economy class redemptions obviously use less points. Therefore, from a value perspective it would seem logical to use points to buy airfares for members of a charity group under the nonimate a friend (limit of 5 per person) via redemption. I would like to know if ""friend A"" received some Krisflyer Points whether that friend A can then nominate another five friends within a charity group so that they can be used by a number of employees within a chairty. Charities could have some of the airfares paid for using points (they have to pay tax and airfuel) Alternatively the ponts could be auctioned at a business function (eg business airfare return to Europe) and the proceeds donated to charity. Not sure on the legality and how many times a friend can be nominated. I am not sure how many times you can change redepmtion nominees or whether points received from another Krisflyer member can be transferrred to other members. I also have this dilemma. More Krisflyer or even Qantas points could easily be collected from business colleauges to used for charitable purposes. However, if I became serious in collecting points and giving them to charities, this approach may be disruptive to the airline business model. From reading other threads it would seem that that there is a limited amount of redemption inventory and a serious appoach to collecting points and providing them to charity for flights may be detrimental to the airline and other Krisflyer members. Also as I believe that the points system is set up so PAX can experience the ponty end. I am not sure if collecting points for charities would be a concern to SIA or not. There could be legal implications. I must stress I love SIA and many of my employees and colleauges regularly fly with SIA. I do not wish to do anything that would upset our business relationship with the airline. I guess I need to research these mattters more. Thanks for your previous comments. Gunners. ",1

" Originally posted by stargold View Post Just curious, what is the motivation for KF status other than redeeming on SQ? For example, if you join OZ today and fly 40k within X months, your status will last 4 years minus X months (e.g. 3 months to fly 40k = status for 45 months). This is even before we consider the A3*G which seemingly lasts forever after flying 19k. Given that KF*G has so little over any other *G (and indeed no distinguishable difference at all at the airport), is everyone aiming for KF EG because of redemption? Its like being in a job or relationship that's stuck in a rut. Sheer inertia after 10 years or so. Also, I'm not keen on programmes in which I don't speak/understand the national language if I do need help (and the CA, MS and SN programmes aren't worth the hassle either). ",1
" Originally posted by 9V-JKL View Post Before deciding on which FFP, I would also ask oneself if status is more important or earn/spend ratios are more important. And if earn/spend is important, where would you want to make the redemptions to. Different programs have different spends. I dont know what you SQ/MI ratio is like but if the MI portion is very significant, your choices are very much limited to KF as other *A programs do allow accrual. Do share with us more details of what you're really looking for and I'm sure others will give good advise. BTW, most of us; bar a few; spend way more time in Y than in premium cabins Whether you want upgrades can also be a factor. Upgrading using the airline's own FFP is usually cheaper and may be the only way to upgrade, ignoring op-ups. Note the *A mileage upgrade program (across selected airlines) requires a fairly high booking class (read generally expensive fares). ",1

" Originally posted by SQ002 View Post Hello, I recently joined the Krisflyer! I travel semi-annually on SQ 1/2 (HKG-SFO) on Y (usually discounted fares). I want to know some tips on how to make the most out of my membership, and realistically the chances of being invited to upgrade or use the Krisflyer lounge. Not a premium customer here but I would like to enjoy the SQ charm if I could! Thanks~ Welcome to Krisflyer! Some observations as a longtime KF (Gold) member: SQ focuses it's loyalty program on J and F passengers...that is their PPS program...you get decent benefits as Star Alliance Gold / Krisflyer Gold but the real differentiation is for pax who fly Business/First/Suites, which is where PPS comes in. You can only ever be PPS if you fly Business or First. And then they will do extraordinary things for you (Or so I have heard ) For frequent flyers who fly economy (I am in this category), Star Gold / Krisflyer Gold does have benefits, although even this this pales compared to PPS. It's 50K miles to Gold. Gold is worth maintaining if you travel frequently as there are benefits that make flying more comfortable. Once you reach Krisflyer Gold, you will have preferential choice of seating, priority check in, priority waitlist, additional luggage, priority boarding, and also access to Star Gold Lounges (Including SQ lounges, except, that you don't get access to the SilverKris Lounges in Changi, SIA's home base. As KF Gold, you only get access to the Krisflyer Gold Lounge.). Upgrades? Almost never happens on SQ, and never because you are KF Gold (Since PPS will always have priority over KF Gold for upgrades). Courtesy upgrades? You are probably more likely to be struck by lightning on a sunny day in Singapore. However, SQ does upgrade you (Or anyone else for that matter) when overbooked. As Star/KF Gold, I have been upgraded to J several times when Y was overbooked (But only when overbooked, never as a courtesy upgrade)...MEL-SIN, ICN-SFO, BKK-SIN, SIN-CMB. Just last month, I was offered an upgrade, at the check-in desk, from Y to J (For next day travel — not on my booked flight, on either A350, A380 or 777 J) the next day because the BOM-SIN sector I was confirmed on was overbooked. But I had to decline, and flew on my Y booking, because I only had a day to spend in SIN before my next SQ flight... As KF Gold, you are Star Gold. In some cases, that means you may be treated better on other Star Alliance carriers than on SQ. I've been op-uped to J on Lufthansa (MUC-SIN) as Star Gold. And Star Gold lets you into the LH Senator lounges in FRA, MUC and elsewhere. And onboard SQ flights, SQ service is pretty good whether you are KF Gold, PPS or anything else...you are at least assured of that. Are you based in SIN or HKG? If based in HKG, and if you fly mainly Y, I would actually go for the CX program (Although CX seems to be going through a rough patch right now) or one of the Oneworld programs, as the CX/Oneworld lounges are better than the Star Alliance lounges, and my impression is that Oneworld airlines treat Sapphire members (Which is the equivalent of Star Gold) better than SIA Krisflyer treats KF Gold. And if you attain Oneworld Emerald (Possibly with just Y travel), the benefits and op-ups become more frequent. I was previously Oneworld Sapphire/Emerald, and I was upgraded from Y to J on quite a number of occasions: MEL-SIN on QF, SIN-LHR on BA, SIN-HKG and HKG-SIN on CX, and DOH-SIN on QR. Hope this helps!

While Krisflyer (and many other programmes) go by the ""mileage"" route (e.g. 50k in a year to get gold), VSFC requires you to accumulate tier points. On each of their routes, you can earn up to (I think) 4 tier points depending on your class of travel. However, you only earn these tier points if you credit your trip to VSFC. In short, tier points are simply the VSFC ""equivalent"" of Krisflyer ""Elite Miles"", i.e. the means by which you rack up credits towards attaining FF status. On any given trip on VS, you can choose to credit your miles to EITHER VSFC OR another affiliated mileage programme (e.g. Krisflyer). What happens after that depends on the programme you choose. There will be no link between the two. ",1

However, I think SQ's upgrade policy is actually no different than that of a lot of other airlines (no upgrade unless necessary) - except perhaps SQ's policy on F on the A380 (I haven't kept up with whether this has changed or not ?) - and SQ do upgrade more than just a few people out of necessity. Quite a number can be found on here! http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=91 Indeed, and I am not saying there aren't op-ups on SQ as I've had two myself. However, they are known to be notoriously stingy with them compared to other airlines, especially the US carriers, who were mentioned for comparison by the OP. The US airlines policy has always baffled me to be honest, handing it out for free.

I agree with you the airline lounge is not a hotel, but under these circumstances when one is on ""transit"" during these hours, its the obligation of a carrier to provide ""a resting place"" In the good old days, SQ used to pay for a hotel if the transit was overnight, but over time, SQ decided to drop this.

I also do not liked the way SQ treated the passengers liked you (when you were short of 3,000 miles to LPPS). Just for my case only, I would have done a mileage run and fly the cheapest economy on SQ or other airlines and it will cost SQ to maintain my LPPS status.

" I speak with limited experience VC10 Boy, but will try to assist. I suppose the first question would be which frequent flyer programme are you trying to use to redeem the award seats? If it's anything other than KrisFlyer, I believe that folk will say you'll have only a very slim (or no) chance of scoring two seats on the same flight (correct me if I'm wrong,...just what I've heard from other board members). On the other hand, with KF, the picture appears to be more hopeful. The second question is, are you prepared to be *slightly* flexible with the date/time you fly? I've just done a quick dummy booking search for 2 First Saver awards on the KF booking site and it shows clear availability for every day in December (I tried from the 1st to 31st inclusive). Granted, on some days only SQ833 is available, but on perhaps 90%+ of the dates, both SQ833 and SQ825 have two First Saver award seats free for booking. I haven't tried searching for availability of regular (non-saver) F awards, but presume there will be even more availability. It seems, however, that it might be best to save your miles and go for the F saver award (well, that would be my thoughts). Because there seems to be plenty of seats available, it might be better to change your plans ever so slightly in order to get F rather than J seats. Hope this helps in some way ",1

" For a short while, I was AA highest tier (emerald? can't remember the name). Even then, when I travel on CX - which is just a OneWorld partner airline, I was treated very well. Got upgraded a couple of times. Always greeted by name even when travelling on Y. Re : Calling the PPS Coordinator My experience so far is mixed. When I'm waitlisted (either commercial or redemption booking) and I needed that slot desperately, I always make it a point to call them. No harm getting someone to give that extra push. But I'm sometimes frustrated by the answers given. I'll appreciate if they just give me the impression (whether or not thats the case in reality) that they'll try. But sometimes, I get stupid answers like : ""the Savers award is full, but if you use more miles instead you can snag a Standard award"". Hello?? I know that. In fact, if I'm desperate/stupid enough, I can even buy a one way ticket instead of making a redemption booking. These kinds of comments, coming from a PPS Coordinator, is of no value added. Originally posted by StarG View Post Nice story, jagmeets. Sounds like CX got two customers for life. I know CX treats its DMs very well. I used to be GO myself. My friend who is a DM, never bother to buy F anymore. He gets upgraded 'most of the time' on the route he does. SQ does open up award inventory for redemption to PPS members - usually one needs to get waitlisted first. When flights aren't full, they do get those confirmed. PPS members should get in touch with their PPS coordinators, which can do more for them than the normal call center. Good stories on SQ do happen from time to time, in my experience. It all depends on who you get in touch with, be it in the call center, on the ground, or in the air. The ones with good customer service spirits always make me can't wait for my next flight on them.

" Originally posted by sqdazz View Post This is quite fantastic. SIN-SFO on SQ16 one way 50% discount (Y) makes it 17500 miles! Thats quite incredible. 25% off is very nice too, makes Melbourne-London 56250 miles in J Class. It IS quite incredible. But the $ cost now is also incredibly low for the same routing over the same period - that is, if you have a pair of travelers. It's only S$847 (excl. a surcharge of S$645) for travel all the way into June, and, I presume, with a greater selection of flights. Makes one wonder if the current Krisflyer promotion can be considered, or not, as a reinstatement of mileage value following the last few years of dilution.

But to do this booking, I need to call their ICC almost everyday for the past week as they always say that there is no availability for HKG-SIN on the particular day.

I know of some UA folks scoring 2-3 F seats in a go on one flight and booking trips worth a total of like 1.5 to 2MM UA MP miles (nice to have that many ). Given that SQ does not allow any holds they kicked themselves here and most of those tickets were issued right away. Autsch .. and of course not that great for the rest of us as it could mean that SQ F availability could again become a scarce commodity. SQ is not the victim here, it's Krisflyers like you and I: SQ had earmarked the seats for redemption bookings anyway - just not planned to release them to partners. What's the consequence? The seats are gone and now not available to Krisflyers. Whatever flights I looked up last night, often even 'standard' was only available on waitlist. SQ is getting good money for those seats from its partners and as the seats were not planned to be sold, this will do the P&L good - maybe the move wasn't that unintentional after all? ",1

" PPS Value Crediting Anomaly I never realised this until very recently and was shocked at how incompetent the system was. Basically, check your PPS Value crediting yourself as there's a good chance that you've been shortchanged. Here's the reply from Singapore Airlines on this matter: ""I understand your concerns, and I wish to add that incidents of the automatic crediting are normally only for flights departing from the United States. Additionally, the default value will be credited at the 70th percentile of all Business Class fares collected for the flight, so that the value is equal or higher than the actual fare paid, to reduce incidences of our passengers being short-changed by the automatic crediting. On the rare occasion that the default value is lower than the actual value, it remains for the time being that KrisFlyer Membership Services will have to be contacted to reverse the automatic crediting. I am sorry for the inconvenience, Mr XXX, and I hope that you would bear with us in the meantime as the system is being reviewed."" So it's our job as a Singapore Airlines customer to help them do their audits ",1
" PPSV (the value itself, not the programme) has never made sense since they started it. I have had some frankly bizarre PPSV's over the years, especially on RTW tickets as tfung says on the first post of this thread and also on one way tickets. I haven't flown a CRTWSTAR or FRTWSTAR ticket for a while now so no idea if it is still the same but some of the values on one way tickets are strange. On this subject I have to say that while I can see why they went down the value route rather than PPS sectors, and indeed others are now following suit, I don't think they fully considered the implications of dropping LPP and then introducing PPSV Reserve. I was speaking to a fellow TPP SQTalker in Singapore last week who has got over 6 years worth of PPSV Reserve. As a result he has been flying CX, JL etc and keeping top tier status in OW as well. I do exactly the same but we both agreed in they still had LPP we'd be flying SQ more instead. ",1

" Originally posted by EKrew View Post Taipeiflyer - why would you say so ? I was just sharing an example of the small majority of cases whereby members take advantage of the airline. Trust me, i had better things to do at 03:00LT when i posted this message than to make up stories. There are two sides to every coin. PPS/TPPS members who take advantage of the goodwill of airline is not something I myself do not find it pleasant and degrade the image of other PPS/TPPS. I think it is good that EKrew do let us know how some of these priority pax behave. Many of us are loyal customers of SQ and support her in good and bad times and we have to pay a premium for a seat in either C or F Class over other airlines. The unapologetic attitude of SQ in raising the PPS/Solitaire threshold while at the same time reducing benefits itself does is not exactly the best way in giving us that endearing feeling to SQ. For example trying to bring my 4 year old daughter to the lounge together with my wife is that I almost have to beg SQ to let us in as a family and lounge entry for the 3 of us is considered by SQ to be doing us a really big favour despite spending an average of 50K a year on premium travel. In fact, up to a point, I make it a point to fight harder if there are ticketing issues or enjoy more of the remaining benefits from SQ. However, I will not be drawn to acting in a ""cheap manner"" as describe by EKrew. In my personal belief is that yes there are ""cheap"" or ""PITA"" members but most of us are not. ",1

However, the KrisFlyer Gold Lounges don't have showers, so I don't think the lounge you'd have been able to access for free with status would have been what you were looking for anyway. However, as SQ747 suggests, you can use the vouchers claimed via the transit voucher programme to access the Ambassador Transit Lounges, which do have showers. They're not free, though most people think of them as being ""free"" since they paid no money out of their own pockets for them by using the aforementioned vouchers. I believe you should be able to claim the vouchers by presenting your ticket/boarding pass at the iShop Changi counters in the transit area. Any information counter will be happy to direct you there (or wherever else they are issuing vouchers at the moment). One issue you might have is that I think they're discontinuing the transit voucher programme sometime in April or May, so you may not be able to collect any, and hence will have to pay to use the transit lounge. Also, one other thing: if you want to go land-side there's an arrival lounge (with showers, I believe) in T3 you can use (for a fee). ",1

" Originally posted by jhm View Post As someone who (like a lot on this board) does manage to get a lot of value out of my miles (compared to many more who don't), I don't want it to be regulated so it's ""fairer"" for all! More seriously, isn't limited or no availability and the rules changing part of the ""game"" which everyone agrees to when we sign up ? If you don't want to play, then pay full price (i.e. use cash rather than points); or move to another FFP (like I did when I dumped KF). I accept that with my FFPs there are limitations - e.g. with BAEC, very limited availability to SIN/BKK/SYD - and plan accordingly. jhm, I'm pretty sure people who invest time (like us on this board? ) to understand the system better will always get more out of it. Regulation isn't going to change that. There will always be examples of good and bad regulation, and I would NOT suggest ""over"" regulation. But I do think that simple rules surrounding things such as: - restricting the percentage of ""devalution"" an airline can force over a period of time, - ensuring that there is a minimum amount of ""availability"" as a ratio to the number of miles issued by an airline, Surely these are useful to the consumer...? Again if financial services providers are increasingly regulated, why not airline mileage programs? I agree - to an extent - that we ""sign up to the game"", and yes for sure mileage redemptions availability should always be less ""attractive"" than a paid ticket. But on the other hand, air miles are a financial instrument - they are of significant ""value"" to many people who accrue them, and they are marketed as such by airlines - and for those reasons surely the airlines should not have 100% carte blanche to devalue them and restrict their usage to the point where they become unusable (in the future)?

" Originally posted by Kyo View Post Funny - my corporate travel agent this past Thursday said there'd be a $150 no-show fee if I didn't turn up for my 01:15AM flight y'day. Furthermore, they also said I'd be charged $100 if I changed by paid J to a C in order to fly on SQ802 (08:45AM departure and also 77W) instead of SQ800 (01:15AM departure). They sent me a whole bunch of Fare Conditions which I only half-understood (and the average layperson would have ZERO chance of understanding, I'm sure, I might even post this up one day so the real Travel Agents on this forum can interpret what it said) that *seemed* to say I couldn't change flights. Three quick calls to Krisflyer confirmed my suspicions that there was no charge if I wanted to fly on SQ802. I paid the standard admin change fee of $75 (because this was not issued by SQ, but by our corporate travel agent) and moved to SQ800. Almost ironically when I rocked up to Gate A9 after all that kerfuffle, 9V-SQL was waiting on the tarmac. Absolutely disappointing. I was planning to swap my return seat with my client so I could give 77W J to them instead on the return leg from PEK as they are in Y. Now I'll have missed out on both chances to try 77W J (for more than five minutes) for mid-haul. And did I get op-upped as a result? Not a chance! Haha... Anyway, no Shi Quan Shi Mei, no further motivation for me to consider flying F on this route. From what I know, SQ802 & SQ805 business class is C class ticket, so costs $100 more for each flight. So is SQ16 business class to ICN, it is C class ticket. So these flights have a higher business class cost. If you do a dummy booking, you can see the cost is actually more than SQ800, SQ810 & SQ602. My coming SQ16 to ICN is shown as C class on my e-ticket. ",1

" Originally posted by crazycrab955 View Post Forgive the totally clueless nature of this question, but as an SFO-based traveller, this thread holds a lot of relevance for me. Do the security/TSA personnel at the A pier in the Intl terminal have any issues with allowing SQ boarding pass holders through security to enter the VS clubhouse? As the VS Clubhouse is located in the opposite airside wing to the G pier (where SQ flights depart), I would think you'd at least get some funny looks from the people checking boarding passes and IDs. Any thoughts on this? VSCH is located in the public area of the other end of the wing (from SQ). To get to VSCH, you don't go through security. Rather, you take the elevator left of the security area up a floor or two. The CH is right by the elevators. However, if it's not open, you won't know where it is, as there are no signage, unless they've fixed that problem. ",0

" As I wrote in my original post, I think these are excellent moves in the right direction. Does this make PPS programme perfect? Nope. I want easier access to J/F Savers as a TPP. But so far my waitlists for Saver awards have been mostly cleared. Of course by using Saver awards, I am usually more flexible in flight time/date choices. So far, their waitlist clearance have been quite reasonable. From what I have been told, there may be some changes coming. What those are, I don't know yet. I like that they are listening to our feedbacks nowadays (YQ PPS value inclusion, arrival access to lounges, extension of Reserve Value validity, etc), rather than the genius bean counters who made them cut costs everywhere to survive. For me, the only TPP benefits I can remember still missing from the 'golden era' are: - Anytime SKL access (when flying other airlines -- with no guest allowance) - Unpublished benefits like birthday gifts, which is a nice touch to remind SGD25k annual spenders that they are appreciated. Things that I think will help to make us feel more loved : - More consistent onboard recognition (CX is very good at this -- although with not so sociable crew-in-charge, we risk having to endure a lame conversation at the beginning of the flight ) - Complimentary upgrades for special occassions. Okay, if upgrades during/near birthdays are too many and too costly, maybe do that for some PPS milestones? Every five years in the club perhaps?

" The SilverKris Lounge in Terminal 2 Changi Airport will be renovated from May 2011 The lounge facilities in Terminal 2 Changi Airport will be upgraded from May 2011 to September 2011; and when completed, the SilverKris lounge at Terminal 2 will have new First and Business Class areas. There will be 126 and 246 seats in the First and Business Class area of the SilverKris Lounge respectively. Both sections come with their own dining areas, food service counters, bars, television areas, showers and washrooms as well as nursing rooms. The walls and flooring will be adorned in rich timber and marble. The entire lounge will be WiFi-enabled, allowing you to surf the internet from wherever you are seated. Internet workstations will also be available for use and an extensive range of newspapers and magazines will continue to be on hand. The refurbished Terminal 2 SilverKris Lounge promises to provide an inviting environment for Singapore Airlines Suites, First and Business Class customers as well as PPS Club members to rest or work before boarding their flight. A KrisFlyer Gold lounge will be a new addition, welcoming KrisFlyer Elite Gold members and Star Alliance Gold members traveling on Economy Class who currently use the SATS Premium lounge in Terminal 2. In order to minimise disruption to our members, the SilverKris Lounge will remain operational throughout the renovation period. In order to do so, upgrading works would have to be carried out in phases. In the first phase, the First Class section will be converted into an interim common lounge for PPS Club members and Singapore Airlines customers traveling in the premium cabins, while work is carried out to refurbish the Business Class section and convert part of it into a new KrisFlyer Gold Lounge. The First Class section will be upgraded once renovation works in the Business Class section and new KrisFlyer Gold Lounge is completed, and we will update our members again on the next phase of renovation. We seek your kind understanding and apologise for the inconvenience this may cause. http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...ws/news_01.jsp ",0

" i believe it is a personal choice... however, i think any person will not say that it is MUCH better than *G, especially in light of the recent changes. if you already fly C and F predominantly, than there is really no difference at all, unless you are a heavy packer, in which case you get to check in 2 extra bags per family member (even if the rest of your family members are not PPS). in addition, you will get in flight vouchers somewhere in the neighborhood of 200SGD..however, considering you have to spend an additional 6000SGD just to qualify for PPS, you could take that 6000, park it in a short-term, interest yielding CD, and make more than 200, while trying out some other nice flight products, and saving some money along the way (never a bad thing in this economic climate). furthermore, therehave been instances (more than one actually) when trying to access the lounges of united and us airways, where my PPS card actually caused more trouble than just carrying a regular old *G card. the dragons would read ""PPS Club"" and think that it was the same thing as Red Carpet Club, and inform me that SQ's club does not have reciprocity. This is despite the fact that my BP also had the number and STAR GOLD on it, in addition to the fact that the PPS card states it is STAR GOLD. my personal take, go for PPS if you love flying SQ, and you will qualify on your travels alone... but don't spend unneccesary money for it, when other options are cheaper, or change itineraries to go far out of your way to fly SQ metal. the benefits of PPS justaren't worth it anymore. all that being said, it has been reported on here that several of the LHR-SIN 747 routes are being grounded because of low yields and the high fuel they burn, so there is the chance you could be upgraded to the A380 if that happens. however, it is certainly not my place to speculate on the odds of that happening. either way, enjoy your travels.

That effectively means my annual spend on SQ is between 25 to 30% per year of what it used to be. That's a sensible strategy. ",0
" I have not made my effort to visit this lounge. Always in a rush when connecting at SFO. Thus drop the idea for VS lounge, except for my last flight with DFP when I had time from 6pm till midnight for that particular SQ 1 D. The VS lounge is not airside. There is a lift to go up to the mezzanine near the hallway to go to the USAir Satelitte. So basically you have to go to the opposite direction from where SQ check-in and security for gate 91-10s. Again, I am sure the opening time should depend on the VS flight schedule that day. Will check the openinng time next week when I am flying out SFO to FRA. Note: I believe Lobster had visited this place last summer. ",0

" I'd recommend taking a one-way J saver to make full use of the miles. Since most of us do not fly paid J cept for company travel or are loaded, I suggest you try HKG-SIN for the A380/77WN products. If you feel a tad more adventurous, you could carry on the sector to CGK/DPS to make full use of the ticket for the same amount of miles. (As long as transit is less than 24hours) As for getting to HKG, scoot offers cheap one-way fares and a Dreamliner experience too at real affordable prices. Also should u travel to CGK/DPS, a one-way return would cost no more than $100. AF had $42 CGK-SIN fares awhile ago or maybe if you feel like spending a lil more, PY is at $130.

I saw Chartis but must depart from Singapore ... Please advise on insurance and if the station manager ever put me in Y class - I got the absolute right to demand J class and most probably ask him to call SQ himself to help me rebook right ?

If you achieved the past renewal criterial 25 sectors or 50,000 miles before 31 Aug 07, you will be renewed upon your renewal date.

" Soon to be in SIN, with stingy employer: which FFP? Hallo everyone, this is my first post on here after having found you via a hint on FlyerTalk. If possible, I would appreciate your advice on the situation I will be finding myself in soon. I am moving out to SIN from LON in Feb/Mar 2009 with work and will be doing a lot of travelling in SE Asia. Most of this (90%) will be done in whY, with the very occasional trip in J and none in F. Main destinations will be Jakarta, Manila, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai, Beijing, Colombo, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok (if they will have opened their airport again by then), amounting to 3-4 rtn trips per month. In addition, there will be around 4 roundtrips to Europe (Switzerland and Germany) per, annoyingly also in Y. I noticed from a few random fare comparisons on Kayak that SQ almost always seems to come out twice as expensive as MH, for instance. As a consequence, my employer will prefer to put me on Malaysia Airlines, so I won't be able to accumulate miles on * Alliance too often. Similarly, CX are also quite pricey in comparison. I have no status in any FFP apart from soon Silver on BA EC. I would like to use the FFP benefits mostly to access lounges in airports and to use accumulated miles to upgrade to J on long flights within Asia (e.g. China) and Europe. Unfortunately, from what I have read, Malaysia's Enrich program seems not to be a good FFP, although they are a good airline. Since I will be based in SIN, do you think it would be a good idea nonetheless to aim for PPS on KF, or Elite Gold, in particular if I get a KF AmEx card and take advantage of other ""local benefits""? Or is there a trick to funnel my miles on MH into M&M? I saw that Enrich does credit miles flown on LX to their members accounts, but vice versa? I hope you can see my predicament and would appreciate your advice a lot! Many thanks, Wally ",1

" Originally posted by 259850 View Post Not necessarily true. They always prioritize international flights, to the point I often get in and out of PEK much faster than my HKG-based colleagues, who are not considered ""international"". There doesn't seem to be any priority given to CA over foreign airlines, and some suggest the opposite might be true to ""save face"". Make sure your baggage is checked through directly to MEL from TSE. Immigration lines - both in and out - can be ridiculously long during peak periods. On top of that T3 is huge - the gates and check in area are connected by a train. PEK has a 1hr cutoff for check-in, but even that may be cutting it real close. [I wrote this when I read you have a 4hr transit, but now you have 11hrs. 11hrs is a bit tricky - I really wouldn't want to stick around in the airport for so long (see comments about the lounge below), but given traffic unpredectability, not even sure if it is worth getting out. Neither here nor there.....not sure how to advise you.] It's a contract lounge. Adequate, but nothing to shout about. Actually, it is quite run down. I often just wander out and get coffee at Starbucks or something. Thank you for this information, it is quite helpful to frame my mind for what I'm going to experience. It was either a 3.5 hour or an 11 hour connection. I'm pretty good at entertaining myself if I need to and I don't get bored easily, so I'd rather arrive relaxed knowing I can't miss my next flight than racing through an unpredictable environment, worrying about forfeiting 75k miles if I don't make it in time. I'm not overly optimistic about CA check-in agents in TSE wanting to check my bags through to MEL, or PEK's ability to handle them correctly, so now I have plenty of time to cover that factor. If the lounge is drab, at least I can find a quiet corner to sit and read in and I'll be happy. ",1

" Just a quick question, mrs nickbot and I are hoping to soon redeem award flights using KF miles for the total sum of 150,000 miles each (therefore 127,500 after the online 15% discount) - neither of us have this full amount in our KF accounts, but do have at least the requisite 70% minimum, so shall need to purchase some miles at the US$40 / 1000 KF miles rate. My query is this - how do we go about booking award seats and also purchasing the extra miles at the same time? I'm presuming there's an option during the redemption booking to click a tickbox saying ""I'll send in the faxback miles purchase form shortly"" as part of the booking or similar? An added complication is that we each have to make a seperate booking (neither of us has sufficient miles to pay for both tix) - the only way round this I can see is to search for 2 seats, find the days/flights with availability, then for both of us to sit there with laptops and make the bookings at the same time to avoid missing out on availability! Fingers crossed, we're going to try to redeem miles before any 77W-esque double redemption mileage rules come in for the A380, and take a gamble on securing seats in A380 Business Class on the LHR-SIN-SYD-SIN-LHR route (SIN-SYD-SIN in particular) towards the end of March next year before the A380 schedule is announced. I'm conscious that time is against us, so want to act on this ASAP! Any help would, of course, be very much appreciated Many thanks in advance, nickbot ",1

I'm gonna ask them to pay for the difference in tax since it's their fault for not ticketing early. Agent had apologized for overlooking the booking. Imagine if I did not call Krisflyer after assuming it's a confirmed flight... Some compensation for the time spent calling (over 30plus calls, serious) and the difference in taxes is fair - I think. I did request for stopover though.. I'm not sure - she'll speak to her superior and had not heard from her since. Really upset that I can't take the NH flight .. Haiiz ",1

The lounge is pretty small and doesn't display the elegance of the Sydney one. Yes, you will find elements of the new concept but it's more like how do I get ten different things in a room that has only space for five? Staff here is incredibly uninspired and unmotivated - no pride in offering a new lounge, zero customer service attitude, no smile on record. To make matters worse, no supervisor around and absolutely no interest in how people like the lounge or service. Disappointing. ",0

Prior to my first ever F flight with SQ in Feb of last year, I was so alerted by CGK's post that ever since I've flown SQ F, I have always stowed the menus into my carryon immediately upon distribution and would only take them out to browse and make my meal order selections. Not only the menus, but I have also always taken the leather covering with me as well. Just hope no one here is going to flame me for being a PITA naughty theft. Just my mindset is that since myself or my company has paid the price for a F ticket, one should be entitled to keep the menus as the price of the ticket more than enough covers the cost of one leather and menu printing materials.

" Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post If I were QPP now and would have to push myself to make TPP, I wouldn't do it. The cost-to-benefit ratio was whacked out of alignment by the recent changes (though the ""godlike treatment"" remains shrouded in mystery). If I were already TPP, I'd try my best to maintain it. The requalification criterion doesn't seem as onerous as that for first-time qualification, and even the current privileges make a certain travel pattern very comfortable (for example, lots of Y/C travel on SQ, which makes F checkin and lounge access more convenient; travel with family and the resulting need for more luggage; shopaholic tendencies on vacations and the resulting need for more luggage). As I said, though, a theoretical exercise for me. Well put, theoretical or not! It's all about the incremental cost required to obtain the incremental benefits. ",1

" Originally posted by AsiaCommuter View Post To be clear, the fact that I managed to get at these Saver awards was luck and I am sure it was not the intention of SIA. There was/still is a system issue from what I can still see, after my bookings were confirmed I phoned PPS club who argued with me telling me it was impossible to book Savers Awards with latest products until March 8th without exception... This was not the case for all routes and all dates (I checked other routes). I have noticed inconsistencies, which I guess will be resolved after the 8th when the change is applied properly and officially. I can confirm I finally secured Saver awards bookings (ticketed) for 8 long haul flights in F (77W) and 2 Business Saver awards in J (388). If you try with certain connection to other routes and markets I noticed the Saver awards were not always possible, I also noticed more F than J saver availability based upon what I found. Having said that I got everything I wanted before the 8th March. The first and only time SQ website did something good for me Still can't book SIN HKG on F saver (77W) as of now.

SQ's Fuel taxes are hovering on insanity sometimes, and you will pay more of that since every flight you take will be out from KL. Not to mention the mileage burn ratio is higher on SQ.

" Originally posted by Wan1dap View Post So why keep flying with them? I can guarantee nothing will change because of your lecturing. Much better to simply fly others because of course they don't have any of these terrible problems. I'm sure you'll be much happier. Wan1dap: You have raised a very valid question...why keep flying with SQ. I think on balance, SQ does a very commendable job, given the tough business environment (apart from their 3rd rate website...). That said, I do believe that SQ fundamentally has forgotten how to to capture and retain a customer's loyalty and advocacy, the way they did in earlier years, when they were on their way to becoming the market leader. These days, my impression is that SQ takes loyalty for granted, not realizing how much this has been eroded over the years by cutbacks and reductions in benefits. Apart from QPP, TPP, LPP members, who have seen their benefits eroded, there are also whole swathes of other customer segments, e.g. KF Gold members, for whom SQ has not done much to foster their loyalty. I fly SQ a lot, mainly in Y. For many years, I flew only SQ. I have been KF Gold practically from the first year the Krisflyer programme started. Over the years, I flew more and more, to the point where, in terms of mileage, I qualified for Gold several times over in a single year. But because I fly mainly in Y, KF Gold is all I get. In early years, I used to receive a complimentary companion ticket once a year if I booked a paid ticket for myself, but that stopped too. A couple of years ago, I wrote in to SQ customer service with a request: given my spend on SQ, surely there could be more they could offer in terms of their loyalty programme. Nope, after several exchanges, the inevitable result: your feedback is noted, but nothing can be done as programme rules are rules. I am pretty sure none of my correspondence made it past the bottom one or two levels of their customer service operation. Obviously my loyalty to SQ had been only one-way up till that point. Since that time. I have changed my travel patterns, and I have become much happier. I still fly SQ a lot. I enjoy, and am quite satisfied with, the benefits that KF Gold / Star Alliance Gold provide. SQ have my complete loyalty each requalifying year, until I hit 50K miles and qualify for Gold. For me, that happens in 3-4 months more or less. Then for the rest of the year, apart from SQ, I also explore the delights of QF, AA, CX, JL, EK, BA, AF, MH and everyone else that I was previously too blinkered in my blind loyalty to try, and guess what, they have all impressed me in many different ways. I also probably spend a third of what I used to spend on SQ each year, with the rest going to the other airlines listed above. I remain an SQ fan. It is just that instead of automatically and instinctively choosing SQ, the carrier that I know most intimately and love to fly, I now make cold, calculated decisions about which airline to fly for each trip, and what value I will get from that carrier. Not unlike how I imagine SQ make decisions on how to treat their passengers in different market segments. So why fly SQ? Many good reasons, and some great ones. But at least for me, SQ will have to do a little more before they become an automatic first choice again. ",1

Of all the FFP's I have been a member of, they are the most frustrating to deal with by a country mile. 6 years of banging my head against a wall to get even the most basic things sorted. Unfortunately you cannot use KF miles for upgrades on VS. I'm currently Enrich Silver, but switched to KF after finding out that Enrich was truly a crappy program. I was actually set to be on KF for life, but that is going to change soon, or rather now. The whole point of me joining this was for the upgrades from Economy to Business. Now that W class is not entitled, or rather, double miles required, it seems that it's not worth it anymore. I stopped using my Visa and relied just on Amex for every single purchase just to earn those miles. I have read the open complaint letter, but seriously, what are the chances? Before SQ made this decision, I am sure they have considered all the factors before OK-ing the new rules. The benefits from these new rules were probably justifiable in their books. Even if there would be a change to revert to the old one, it'll probably take 1 year or so. So i'm really hung up on SQ. *shrugs* To be honest, I didn't sleep well last nite, thinking about these new changes! I feel so betrayed, and cheated! I have checked on Enrich, that you will get 150% of the miles flown if I flew on VS PE (K Class). 17,000 Enrich Miles is very worth it I reckon....

" Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post Thanks, LUKE. This means that, in my example above, in the absence of the requal loophole/rule, I could safely switch to focus on another airline (if I so choose) Aug-Sep, and come back to SQ Oct-Dec, for the purpose of PPS requalification. However, due to the requal rule, as described by JJPB3, I should still stay with SQ Aug-Sep, as this will help me requalify easier next year. Yes, your understanding is correct. To summarize, in your case, there are two PPS issues: 1) Early reset of requalification: SQ has been resetting member accounts which have enough sectors/miles 3 months before the formal requalification month. Members which account has been reset, can start earning for the next year's requalification (thus having 15 months max to requalify). Any miles earned before the reset time, will not be carried over to next year's requalification. 2) Requalification loophole: If you fly SQ F/J Aug-Sep, it will add up to your yearly average sectors/yearly average miles, which will help you to requalify easier in tough years when you can only meet at least half the sectors/miles required. However, there is no guarantee that this will continue forever, especially with the rumoured qualification criteria changes. Excess sectors earned in each year also (currently) draw you closer to Solitaire PPS membership. Hope this helps. ",1

 Hi Kyo - hope you have a good flight to our fair city of Adelaide :-) ,1
 I was recently on a flight AMD - SIN and offered an upgrade and I was moved into J cabin. Ten minutes later the FA informed me that someone had not turned up in Y and I was moved back into Y. I was previously in an alse seat in row 33 and they moved be back to the a Y seat in the middle of the plane. Given my height I find an asle seat more comforatable. The FA was unwilling to give me back my former Y seat. You can imagine how I felt after this experience. Maybe elite Y passegers are now being treated as seat warmers for J passengers. I have had to upgrades in 5 years and it only seems to happen when Y is full. ,1

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post A slightly strange way of looking at the situation. SQ have a lounge in KUL as it is one of the largest/busiest markets with a large number of pax going through there per week, many with status. By your logic why have a lounge anywhere outside SIN as almost every flight ends up there?. The length of the flight dictates what is served on board, which in the case of KUL is virtually nothing. NRT is a *A hub and they must deem the NH lounge to be decent enough, unlike TG's lounges at BKK. Until quite recently SQ really either didn't 'get' lounges or the old arrogance of thinking they were alone on a high pedestal meant they didn't need to bother as most were generally poor. The fame of the old SKL F at T2 years ago was only on the back of them serving Dom or Krug in there, and that got royally abused by many people (including a few long standing members of this place ) buying an F ticket to KUL (ironically) or the old system of PPS sectors, and thus much easier to qualify, and the PPS programme previously allowing QPP's in J access to the SKL F. Ah I see your point there on the volume and quality of partner lounges offered. That makes sense. Thanks for sharing ",0

" Been a Centurion member for years now based out of Singapore and NO there is nothing additional or extra that comes your way when you book on Singapore Airlines. Very strange as this is the main carrier for Singapore and having spend $5500,- annual fee you would imagine that you would get some benefit. Even the companion tickets are a big rip off, the fares quoted are the highest fares available when booked through Amex to redeem a ""free"" ticket for your companion. Sad to say the least hence the reason why also many people leave Centurion after a while as there is no benefit. The titanium card is cool that's all, platinum is way more overvalued in Singapore then Centurion. Not sure if Australia does more with the black card for their members on airlines but knowing that it is so easy to even get a simple platinum membership (not by invitation only as with other countries) I would imagine that nothing much is done.

" Originally posted by stargold View Post To be fair, you would have paid the exact same amount in cash (plus perhaps a small service charge) had you booked through any of the Star carriers. It's because UA doesn't list a fuel surcharge for domestic USA flights and there are few other charges within the USA. But sounds like you got very good service too, which is always good (And much better than the traumatic experience that is BD Diamond Club all too often...) That is true, the charges would have been similar with other Star carriers. However if I had booked this with Aeroplan I would have been charged and additional service charge, I think it is C$ 25.00 now for doing the booking over the phone, not sure if it's per person or per booking. I was also really impressed that when I called the Krisflyer number, (local number), I was connected with someone in Singapore not having to wait even 5 seconds on all of the 3 calls I have made to KF. Maybe I am just not used to this anymore, them actually calling me. To me, the ease of making a reward booking and service is very valuable. It is true that earning ratio isn't that great on SQ, the only bonus one gets is 25% if you are Gold or PPS, if I remember correctly. Had I made the exact same booking with Aeroplan, I would have been charged 40,000 miles per person versus the 35,000 miles on SQ. I am only comparing with AC's Aeroplan as this is the only other program I am quite familiar with. I have switched all my North American travel to Delta as they have been most convenient for me with regards to flights and partners but I am finding that there redemption levels are much worse then SQ's. There are pros and cons to every program, this time however KF got 10 out of 10 points from me. ",1

" Originally posted by yongchau View Post Dear all, Usually if Krisflyer award tickets on partner airlines on Star Alliance airlines are issued and you wish to change the flight, date, route or carrier, you will need to pay US$20 or 2,000 miles & top up the additional change in taxes. However, if one of your flights in your itinerary was rescheduled to a later time or changed/downgrade aircraft to aircraft with old seats, you can request to change the flight affected for FREE!! I was very pleased with KrisFlyer today and they gave me a new year present: My award ticket for 5 Star Alliance flights (United, ANA and THAI) from SIN-HKG-NRT-PVG-BKK-SIN was issued in Jan 2010 and the flights I selected on THAI are the flights with new seats, mainly the PVG-BKK (A340-600) & BKK-SIN (new A330, lie-flat shell & 15"" AVOD PTV in Royal Silk Class). However, on 2nd Feb 2010, THAI rescheduled the 5th flight, TG401, BKK-SIN from 1925/2240 to 1940/2255 (15 mins later) and the aircraft was downgraded to the A330-300, with conventional recliner Royal Silk Class seats, 6"" PTV that has only a few movies to choose from on this 2hr 15mins flight. I was shocked and disappointed. Today, CNY eve, I called up KrisFlyer and told the lady my problem. I told her I would like to change TG401 to TG409 at 1625/1940, which is using the new B777-200ER aircraft, with lie-flat shell & 15"" AVOD PTV in Royal Silk Class. She consulted her supervisor and told me that they allowed me to changed the BKK-SIN sector to TG409 and waived off the US$20 admin fee and topping up of taxes (S$44)!! I was so thrilled!! THAI's new Royal Silk Class seats: http://www.thaiairways.com/thai-serv...s-services.htm I think you got the waiver because of the time change solely.

One stopover allowed in each direction, e.g. you could redeem (say) SIN-BKK on SQ, stopover and then BKK to Europe on TG. Finally, you can buy up to 100,000 (IIRC) BD miles each year at a cost of approx. £250 for every 20,000 BD miles. Hilton stays ? 1,000 BD miles per night. BD also send you occasional offers, e.g. complete a 5-minute survey and get 2,500 BD miles! BD - a brilliant programme! I second that! If you are not going to be flying that much and mainly doing short haul flights and thus earning few miles, BD is your best option as the spending power is literally about 3 times better than most other *A FFP's. If you want to use your miles to get your wife out to SE asia every year and attain gold status then BD is the program for you!

" Personally between SATS Premier Lounge in T2 and Plaza Premium Lounge in T1, I would choose the latter if I have plenty of time to spare. The latter has live cooking station where the cook can prepare noodles or laksa for you. There are also more plenty sit down meal area for you rather than sitting on sofa and balancing the dishes with your hands. It is usually not as crowded as well as less airlines contract it for use in Changi. There is also a view of the runway from the lounge. The SATS Premier lounge do have massage chair which you can use if no one is using, but the Plaza Premium Lounge has these productivity pods for your to seclude yourself if you need to get things done. The walk from T1 back to T2 will be far though because the Plaza Premium lounge is located on the opposite side of the skytrain to T2. Alternatively, if you are only looking for good food in a relatively quiet environment, I would recommend TGM at T2, just opposite SATS Premier Lounge. It is a restaurant run by the Plaza Premium Group and features decent Korean and Japanese food (better than the food served inside SATS Premier Lounge.

" Originally posted by jhm View Post SQ could always raise the annual PPS requalification requirement (e.g. 100 sectors per year) but keep the LPPS requirement the same. This would mean that someone would need to fly 8 times a year BKK-LHR (say) - not an impossible target for a frequent business traveller (but too high for the likes of me) - and it would take 10 years to qualify for LPPS. Right, but my point was that some QPPs and TPPs don't have an incentive to demand that kind of change. 100 sectors per year would be a much higher requirement for someone who just squeaks (if you can use that term for someone who spends, or whose company spends, that kind of money) into PPS membership. Existing LPPs, on the other hand, might not mind such a change, just as many immigrants aren't too concerned about seeing the immigration hurdles raised once they've crossed into citizenship themselves. (In fact, IME in the US, some of these same immigrants support the most anti-immigrant initiatives.) ",1

" What I can't get my head around is why SQ offers a ""Seafood only"" meal but no ""Seafood free"" meal. Many people do not like seafood and fish and some are also anaphylatic to many forms of seafood. (But then SQ's love of tossing around peanuts only 20 min into a long haul flight suggests they have little concern about anaphylaxis! But maybe the number of compulsory anaphylaxis training sessions work forces me to sit through has left me bitter and twisted ) So very often, one of the two meal options in Y is a fish offering. And on many such occasions, the last section of the plane to be served gets all the fish that the rest of the cabin didn't want, which leads me also to wonder why they get the balance of the two options so wrong, unless the catering companies operate on a '50/50 only' basis. I'm not a vegetarian and I eat practically everything but NOT fish and seafood. I know many other who are the same. I've been relegated to the fish option enough times to make me contemplate ordering vegetarian, but even though I love vegetables and am quite partial to tofu, I really don't want to potentially consign myself to tofu when so many of the SQ Y meals really are excellent for economy plane food. Is it acceptable passenger etiquette to catch a passing flight crew member after menu distribution and let them know in advance that you can't eat the fish option? I know I could just demand, but I respect the tough job FAs have making everyone happy and try to be a pleasant passenger. ",0

It was much more relaxing that struggling to get up very early to go to the airport. For the OP's route, isn't SIN to Europe the slower direction, so more time in FC than eastbound? I assume the OP has checked aircraft types and looked for lounge information for CDG here and for arrival lounge information for FRA. AFAIK even SQ FC passengers cannot use the LH IFT at FRA for departures, only LH HON and those departing (roughly, with some exceptions for FC connecting to a flight that doesn't offer FC) in FC on either LH or LX.

Look, even if they have 1000 PPS members each giving them a revenue of S$25000 thats a revenue of S$25 million only. So I can understand why they set a high threshold of S$25000. It is not the high threshold, S$25k is not very hard to reach, but they set a time limit of 12 months and you cant carry over. This means, as customers we have to take care how we plan our trips. We want to just make S$25k and not a lot more. When I qualified I had over PPSV of 50k, and instead oif giving me 2 years, they gave me ONE YR and said no excesses are allowed.

" I was surprised to be told at PVG that starting today, SQ is now inviting premium passengers and *G passengers to use the Air China lounge, which is lounge 71. First impression was that this lounge is spacious and newish. But that good feeling was dashed once I learned they do not serve their hot food buffet outside of limited meal times. For example, I got to the lounge at 1:15pm (my flight was the 2:30pm flight), but the buffet was already empty. I saw a sign seeing lunch is not served past 1pm. The only food offerings were tiny sandwiches the size of a matchbox (seriously) and some small cake bits and a bread station with toast and butter. In my opinion, this is ridiculous. Travellers often travel at odd times and need to eat at odd times. The old lounge was not anything special, but at least a hungry traveller could count on a few hot items, whatever time we happen to arrive at the lounge, to tide us over till we get on the plane. Also, an SQ lounge without hot food offerings is just out of the norm. This leads me to ask, the next time I am in PVG, what *G lounges are better to visit? ",0

And if the rumour is true, the dynamic of PPS is nil. Basically flat and boring. Just show me the money. Being a shy, naive and innocent person, it will be an embarrassment to have a PPS card. People knows how much is the spending to get that card - at least SGD 25K (?) or more. My cultural background has taught me not to show off $$$. Note: The pita who demands service will shout ""I am a PPS"" and you know how much I spent! $25,000 at least! ",1

" Why not make the short-ish journey down to SYD to enjoy Spacebeds on the Australia-Singapore sector? Depending on when you're traveling - you could even get a ride on the A380. It all depends on how much you're willing to spend on your trip (and there'$ certainly a po$itive correlation between how much you $pend and how much $Q love$ you ). If you don't mind being hit by all the extra surcharges, definitely check out one of the 77W-operated routes. If you wish to go all the way on *A, FRA (SQ325/326) and ZRH would be ideal - just include extra segments on LH or LX respectively. On the current PPS qualification requirements, most of the European routes will yield the same result. AFAIK they all get 5 sectors except ATH and possibly FCO/MXP. You should get 2.5 for BNE-SIN. Same with SYD/MEL - SIN. You might want to refer to the sticky on PPS sectors for more accurate info. And welcome aboard SQTalk! ",1

" Originally posted by TONY_SQ268 View Post I decided that it would be nice to fly on the A380 so arranged to depart Australia out of Sydney rather than Adelaide where I live. However, due to the way in which SQ have (I think) complicated their fare structure with the new R class, an F class RTW only allows travel in business (D) class on the A380. So I was wondering if anybody might know if on a F RTW ticket I will be able to use the SK First Class lounge at Sydney airport, because my boarding pass will be issued as Business Class. Also if I want to use the BTC service, would I be able to choose from the F class menu or have to use the J class menu? First of all, welcome to SQTalk!. I don't think you will get access to the SKL F at SYD with a Business Class Boarding Pass. In fact I'm pretty sure you won't. FWIW the F lounge at SYD is no better than the J side anyway, in fact I prefer the latter. Even better than both is the NZ lounge at the bottom of the corridor. I am sure the same will apply to your BTC, but I don't suppose it would hurt to ask. On a related note, as much as I can understand you want to 'fly the A380' etc, I would personally go for F on either than 744 or the 77W rather than J on the A380. There is no surcharge for F on the 77W. F is still F is still F, and especially on SQ, F is not something that should be given up easily, A380 or not. Just my tuppence worth... ",0

" ANZ CSOs have not been consistent with answers, so I'll wait till they update their website. I'm not into collecting miles with credit cards as my leisure travel patterns don't optimize miles usage, but I use this card for all my spend except fuel, as it has a very generous cash rebate rate. The 1.4 miles per $1 converts to slightly over 2.5% cash rebate, double that for travel spend (which will go away, but still attractive), and a whopping 7.5% for grocery and EZ-link top-ups! I don't see how ANZ makes money on this card if I kept choosing cash rebates, as interchange fees are only around 2%. I had expected them to change the cash redemption ratios down, not the miles earning rate. Also the current 14k Travel$ monthly cap only applies to the double miles promotion....there doesn't seem to be any cap on regular spend. I just earned more than 15k Travel$ this month (which I promptly converted to cash). ",1
" That's a good question. Bear in mind that they will also open a new SEN lounge (the refurbished old F lounge). I guess *A F pax will be able to use the SEN lounge, or even the new F lounge.

" Hi, Thanks for the Replies. Originally posted by Jamiegutz View Post You need 50% of the miles required for the redemption to be able to top up. I dont think you have enough unfortunately. You may find it easier to buy a ticket especially since redemptions around Xmas are rare. If you really want to use miles, you could take advantage of the current US airways promo which gives 100% bonus on miles purchased. So you could buy 50,000 plus you would receive a further 50,000 for approx USD 1,500. THis is certainly enough to get you a business class return to asia, not sure about Aus though. Take a look.

I was told by the check-in staff that the flight was full but there was nothing to worry about and I should wait in the SIA lounge where I would be assigned a seat.

Dismayed, I refused because I was confirmed in business class. However, I was told there were no other seats available and if I did not take up the economy seat, I would have to wait a few more hours in the airport for the next available flight. In the end, I had no choice but to take the economy seat as I was desperate to return to Singapore to see my family after my business trip in London. I am appalled at this bad service from one of the world's best airlines. I was told by the ground staff that this was not the first time this had happened with SIA and they always had to deal with angry customers like me.

" 24 April 2009 Singapore Airlines is delighted to welcome one of Chinas leading chefs, Zhu Jun (朱俊), as the latest appointment to its International Culinary Panel. To mark his introduction to the Panel, Chef Zhu has exclusively crafted an entire range of mouth-watering creations for Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美), Singapore Airlines signature inflight Chinese dining experience. First Class customers on Singapore Airlines flights from Beijing and Shanghai from 1 May onwards can look forward to this all-new lineup, which includes salad of chicken and jellyfish with cucumber, double-boiled soup with pine mushroom, and stir-fried sliced beef fillet with dried chilli. His dishes will also be available to Business Class and Economy Class customers as menu choices. Customers onboard flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, and San Francisco (via Hong Kong) will continue to enjoy the popular current Shi Quan Shi Mei choices, including dishes designed by Singapores very own Sam Leong, another world-class chef on the International Culinary Panel. Winner of Excellent Chef at the 15th China Chef Festival, Chef Zhus dishes carry his signature Shanghainese influence, with a dash of Sichuan, Huaiyang, Fujian, and Guangdong touches. His latest masterpieces and upcoming creations will no doubt tantalise the palates of many Singapore Airlines customers. Chef Zhu is currently the Vice General Manager and Executive Chef of Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering, one of Chinas leading restaurant chains, and an icon synonymous with elegance, quality and service excellence. Today, Jade Garden is widely known for its commitment to showcasing the best that Chinese cuisine has to offer. Chef Zhus masterful authority of the art of Shanghainese cuisine is one of the main factors in the establishment of the Jade Garden brand. We are pleased to welcome Chef Zhu as the latest member of our International Culinary Panel, and we look forward to his spectacular creations, which I am sure will please even the most sophisticated of tastebuds, said Senior Vice President Product and Services Mr Yap Kim Wah. He added: The International Culinary Panel has truly made an indelible mark on inflight dining, and the addition of Chef Zhu to this lineup of some of the worlds greatest chefs reflects the amazing diversity of international cuisine we serve our customers. Chef Zhu began his illustrious culinary career in 1988, under the masterful apprenticeship of Mr He Ji Sheng, a well-known Min cuisine chef. Early in his career, he also had exposure to classical French and Italian cooking, and this had a significant influence on his present unique style. Chef Zhus innovative approach to Chinese cuisine draws inspiration from his well-rounded experience, deftly combining elements of Western cuisine with the art of traditional Chinese cooking. This resulted in his well-received re-interpretations of numerous traditional Chinese favourites. Many of these new creations, such as Sliced Ham with Honey Sauce, Tea Smoked Duck, and Sautee River Shrimp, have all since become Jade Gardens signature dishes. Chef Zhus outstanding culinary artistry has won him many accolades from peers and the media, including being named Famous Chef of China by the China Cuisine Association in 2006, and being awarded China Golden Chef Elite Cultivation Award twice in 2006 and 2007. He is also currently the Director of Shanghai Cuisine Association. It is an honour to be in the company of such illustrious names on Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. Creating dishes for inflight dining is a unique experience for me, and I take enormous pleasure from meeting this challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this new line of dining choices for Singapore Airlines customers, and I look forward to delighting them with more of my creations, said Chef Zhu. Chef Zhu will join seven other internationally-acclaimed chefs on the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. These master chefs, all authorities in their respective specialisations, are: George Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew James Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States of America); and Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom). About the International Culinary Panel Since its inception in 1998, the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel has continually redefined inflight dining. Tasked with satisfying the demands of an increasingly sophisticated traveller, the Panel has evolved over the years to reflect the diversity of excellent cuisine around the world. The Panel works closely with the Airlines own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available on board. Members on the Panel are Georges Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew James Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States); Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom); and Zhu Jun (China). About Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering Since its establishment in 1999, Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering Co. Pte. Ltd. has developed two key brands - Jardin de Jade and Paradise Garden  and operate a total of 15 restaurants in the Greater China region, including Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou and Macau. Known for its outstanding research and development capability, consistently high product quality, excellent service and elegant dining ambience, the company has won several accolades home and abroad, including being named in the list of Chinas Top 100 Restaurant Brands. Jade Gardens mission is to promote modern Chinese culinary culture to both domestic and overseas customers, presenting to the world the charm and diversity of Chinese cuisine.

Needless to say, it ain't going be left here and an email has already gone back. Watch this space... That is the exact email I receive from them every time I write to explain that my miles have gone to the wrong account through their error of not processing it properly (which is pretty much every time I fly with SQ, unfortunately). It annoys me no end that the sender of the email can't be bothered to read my message properly to understand what has happened, and just assumes that I am being capricious and now want the miles to go somewhere else. After my latest flights I called someone at PPS in Tokyo and asked her to sort it out for me. She faxed me back a day later to say it was being processed, but that there would be no problem. I just needed to wait for several weeks. The next day I received something in the post from SQ saying that one of my flights had been credited, and another was being processed (but both flights showing as F). The day after I received something else in the post showing the flight that was being processed, but now in Y class (I had faxed them my F boarding card). On the same day I received an email saying that that flight had been rejected, because their records did not match my claim. I called up the PPS people in Tokyo, and they told me to ignore the other communication, because apparently their ""system often sends out erroneous messages like this"". All very frustrating, and a huge waste of time! If SQ could manage its mileage and points system, and its CR responses, as well as its inflight service, I would be a very happy monkey!

I only know this as I checked my KF and then DC accounts and can see they have gone from KF and into DC. They still have not as yet bothered to inform me that this has been done. This may have something to do with the way it was going as some of my later emails to them were not very complimentary when I pointed out my annoyance at how something so simple could take so long. Along with a few other comments about the lack of a reply and pointing out I had many better things to do than keep chasing them to rectify their mistake. Still, all's well that ends well I suppose. They have actually given me few too many miles. Not enough to get excited about but it's small compensation for the aggravation. I sincerely hope I don't have to do this again, as it's a real PITA.

" Originally posted by WBT View Post I was wondering the same thing, and as I had to talk to SQ anyway I asked this question a few minutes ago. After some time on hold while the agent checked on this, he said that this was still under review and could not give me a definitive answer right now! That's... surprising? Not ideal? I guess we'll have to wait until they figure it out. One would have thought that they had nailed this down before announcing the changes... I do concur that not being able to waitlist anymore in the T-14 window would be a negative change, but then again, if they do allow it, what's to stop you from re-waitlisting immediately? That would undo the whole (supposed) point of the T-14 cutoff. I thought I'd follow up on this as I have recently been making redemption bookings again. Firstly, you can definitely still waitlist for flights on (very) short notice, as in departing tomorrow. Secondly, it may be the case that waitlisted flights within the T-14 window get confirmed quickly; this just happened to me to a T-13 flight which I'd waitlisted earlier today but I have only one observation thus far. I do have an active T-17 waitlist as well; we'll see what happens in a few days. Thirdly, if this is the case, I don't really see much difference with the old system. I'd be interested in hearing others' experiences with this... ",1

This was the easiest solution and cost same miles anyway. However if you already done the redemption and is confirmed then better to call for assistance but only afraid you maybe wait listed. Good luck hi alian, thanks for sharing your experience. I am intending to do a one-way redemption from TYO to SIN. My preferred flight will be from HND instead of NRT.

" BD DC to SQ KF switch? Following on from this thread, I am now in Singapore and managed to meet my BD*G re-qualification requirement just last week. However, again, I'm thinking of switching to KF. I have around 280k miles in my BD account, enough for some good flying, however, since I usually fly just enough to qualify for *G, I don't make nearly enough use of them. My worry is that if I fly on a redemption ticket, my mileage earning for the year will see me drop from *G. Hence, they are somewhat useless. For me, I think the key value in miles would be for upgrading. I could book my (typically Y or E) tickets on SQ and try my chance at an upgrade, still earning miles for the flight. Looking at the redemption tables, I see that KF isn't as generous as DC, but still not outlandish. And if I'm only ever upgrading, it's not as bad. I have a SG Amex Plat, so that can be linked to my KF account (is it still worth getting the KF Amex?), and I could find other opportunities for earning perhaps. (Recommendations?) The 50k *G requirement is a little daunting as my flying has been averaging near 40-50k recently. (Mileage runs?) My Hhonors earnings of 1000 miles per night on BD would only be 500 miles per stay on KF, which again seems tight. Overall, it could all be solved if BD would just join the Star Alliance upgrades program. Alas. Any ideas? Save somehow turning those BD miles into Amex MR Points? ",1

It the NZ lounge wasn't available I'd rather go upstairs and sit in a bar or cafe paying for my food and drinks than sit in the SKL. The last two times I have been going out of MEL - since the lounge closed - I have been given a $40 voucher for the cafe at the end of Duty Free. The Vine, I think. So I could sit there, see some daylight and enjoy some food and drink and not have to pay. ",0
" While having breakfast at the crew spotter place , I noticed many pax walked by going towards the First Class Check-In lounge from the inside door. I assumed the taxi missed the ramp to the FC Ck-In Lounge. In T2, it is the first door to be drop off for going to the Ck-In lounge. But in T3, the first door will be for crew or Elite Gold check-in counters. Or in another words, missed the First Class ramp. ",0

" Originally posted by Kyo View Post The airside showers seems as though they are in some 'Forest relaxation area' (with massage services for a fee). I would've thought it'd be nice to do it all in one place whilst having complimentary wifi and free drinks also. Is there any reason why the landside showers are better, fumitani? No particular reason, but Landside has more shower booths vs airside. Once you go to airside and the line is so long you might miss your shower and fly smelly. If the landside is full they can check and verify if you can shower airside. Just a higher chance of not missing a shower. ",0
" Apr 2, 2010 SIA says sorry for downgrading, offloading I REFER to the letters by Ms Low Wai Yeng ('Downgraded despite confirmed booking'; last Friday) and Mr Roger Sim ('Offloaded despite confirmed SIA tickets'; Wednesday). We fully understand the frustration Ms Low and Mr Sim went through, and sincerely apologise to them for the inconvenience. Like many other airlines, Singapore Airlines applies an overbooking policy to our flights, because there are usually some passengers who do not show up for a flight, even though they have confirmed bookings. We manage this very carefully, and are generally able to accommodate every passenger who has a confirmed booking in his respective cabin class of travel. In the event that a flight is overbooked, we try our best to secure a seat for the customer depending on seat availability in the various cabin classes, or arrange for an alternative flight. We have been in contact with Ms Low and Mr Sim to address the matter directly with them. Once again, we apologise to them, and look forward to serving them again. Casey Owyong Vice-President, Network Revenue Management Singapore Airlines ",1
" I think we should make a clearer distinction. I believe in his original post SQFAN was referring to the personalized ""permanent"" PPS luggage tags, not the paper priority ones added at airport check-in counters. Ever since SQ abandoned the leather card holders, the personalized PPS tags have a nasty habit of breaking off somewhere during their inaugural flight. I am all for cutting off paper priority tags if the bag's owner doesn't actually deserve the priority. ",1

" Originally posted by leo View Post I really wonder the value of PPS (besides the duty free inflight shopping discounts and fancy luggage tags)... Is it really that worthwhile? So far for me, it has been worth it. When I am flying in Y, from check in to boarding, it has been a breeze. Mention PPS, the check in counter person suddenly becomes more attentive. Requesting for seats get better attention, they will try their utmost best to get me the seat I wanted. More often then not, when flight is not full, seat next to me is empty. Sometimes, not always, on Y flights I get meals served first, FA will come to me to ensure that I get the meal of my choice. Of course there is the discount on duty free at Changi and in flight. I will always buy oxygen sticks on departure from Changi and I get the discount. Not to mention having SKL access in Changi, which is a plus too. For SQ wait list, I always get cleared. My TA will confidently issue ticket on waitlisted sectors for me. Never had once I was not cleared on waitlisted seat. Further, I am always assigned to my preferred seat, even though I was on wait list previously. However, if you only fly on J and F, PPS or not, makes not difference. For poor me, who has to go on Y sometimes, PPS is helpful. ",1
" It all depends where you reside. If you live in Singapore, it is sensible to be on Krisflyer because you have more flight choices and many ways to earn miles. Unless you are specific about your choices in terms of routing and carrier then by all means explore your option. You got to analyse it for yourself. ",1

I mean, the decor is starting to look old and tired, and the food menu... they never changed. And as for service, nothing much to speak of. When it first opened, there was a lot of Wow factor. Now, not so much. I totally agree. The self service buffet options were always poor for a flagship lounge and have recently been reduced further. I just tend to go in there to eat something from the menu then head to the bar in the SKL. And that's the only decent part of the SKL F. To be fair it is going to be revamped, and what they are going to do to it should make it better. But they were originally going to do this two years ago so maybe they are waiting for a cheaper quote to do the work... ",0

" Originally posted by Guy Betsy View Post Not that I am an expert in this...but some of my wine loving friends tell me that CX has a better cellar selection than SQ. Of course CX only serves 1 champagne Krug in F and SQ , 2. I don't know... All I do know is CX's Lynch Bages is famously popular. I stilll have a bottle of '92 somewhere courtesy of an empty CX F flight a few years ago! Haven't got enough experience in F to speak about the wines. From memory, CX served William Deutz Cuvee on some routes and Krug on others. SQ serves both DP and Krug long haul, and only DP on the shorter regional routes. CX wines can be rather hit/miss in J though, SQ whilst predictable is rather dependable. As for the fizz I find it pretty bizarre how CX serves the v delicious party in a mouth, Billecart-Salmon NV (seriously, I'd drink this over DP!!) on its regional routes other than NRT yet offer the paint stripper Champagne Deutz on its long hauls plus NRT! I do realise these things are YMMV but Deutz has been massively unpopular with everyone I've spoken to, even the most ardent CX fans. Surely you'd want to serve the good stuff on your premier routes. SQ serves Charles Heidsieck Mis En Cave which is pretty good as far as NVs go though some of the disgorgements can be rather 'green.' For the best onboard wine list though - I find LH truly a class act in F! And NZ and QF rather solid in J when it comes to the reds and whites, with NZ and CX regional coming out tops for J fizz with the Laurent Perrier NV and Billecart respectively. YMMV of course. ",0

This way, you would get to fly *A carriers all the time and there will be no need to purchase one-way fares on separate tickets.

As a KrisFlyer member, you can now mix miles and cash to pay for your next Singapore Airlines or SilkAir airfare on singaporeair.com. Here's the spiel from SQ on the scheme: Some important information about paying with KrisFlyer miles: * Only applicable to PPS Club and KrisFlyer members * Members can use their KrisFlyer miles to pay for their own airfare(s) and any of their 5 redemption nominees * A minimum of 5,000 KrisFlyer miles required per transaction * Flights must be operated on Singapore Airlines or SilkAir Airfares must be purchased through singaporeair.com * Tickets paid with KrisFlyer miles cannot be used to travel on other airlines * Any miles earned can only be credited to KrisFlyer accounts * To pay with KrisFlyer miles, ensure you are logged in as a KrisFlyer member and check the ""Pay with KrisFlyer miles"" box when choosing a flight. Here are some steps you can use: 1) Firstly, at the SQ Booking page, click on the ""Pay with Krisflyer Miles"" option. Make your destination, dates and class selection and proceed. 2) Go through the flight selection process including the options on the types of fares, choose the range between ""sweet deals"" and ""Flexi"". Move along (I'm fast forwarding here) the booking process until you hit the Payment screen. All you've to do then is to click on the ""Pay with Krisflyer Miles"" option and the secondary window will appear on the bottom right to allow you to adjust the miles you want to use. Once you're happy, click on the confirmation button and the tickets should be issued (assuming the, ahem, website is working properly). And if it doesn't see RCTP's advice. Good luck! ",1

Your sentiments have been conveyed to our Ground Services Department as we continue to review our boarding process, as well as how we can communicate better with our passengers on future initiatives."" Below, is the transcript of my original memo to SIA about this matter: ""Since Q1 2012, passengers of this tier status are no longer able to queue at the Priority lanes but instead are made to queue at normal EYCL lanes. Boarding of Star Alliance / Krisflyer Elite Gold passengers is, at best, ""disguised"" to be ""prioritized"", as we board before EYCL passengers, but after PPS, PCL, and JCL passengers have boarded the aircraft. From your information systems records, you will be able to note that I had been in contact with your Customer Services colleagues on this matter. As a follow-up on this matter, I must highlight that the public relations team could have done better on managing and communicating these changes to the Star Alliance / Krisflyer Elite Gold community. It also seems odd that only Singapore Airlines, and no other Star Alliance carrier has decided to differentiate itself in this regard. Though it has been ""packaged"" to look as though ""priority boarding"" still prevails, being made to queue at the ""normal"" lane does in reality, suggest otherwise; and does contradict with the ""priority boarding"" pledge of the Star Alliance program. I am sure that Singapore Airlines had no intentions to communicate the wrong signals, but this has somehow been taken aboard by Star Alliance / Krisflyer Elite Gold community as appearing discriminatory when compared to the PPS and Solitaire gods and goddesses.""

" There are 2 highly attractive promotions with DBS bank right now : 1) From now till 30 Sep 2014, new DBS Treasures customers who join and deposit fresh funds of at least S$300k will get 40,000 Krisflyer miles (or S$150k for 15k miles). Funds must be held for at least 6 months with DBS/POSB bank. http://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/prom...es-2014-Brand- Note that ""new funds"" means the funds must not exist in the person's existing DBS/POSB account as of joining date. Which means that an existing DBS/POSB bank account holder who's not currently a Treasures customer can wire S$300k out of his funds to another bank, sign up for Treasures, wire that funds back in, and its considered ""new funds"". And as an alternative, the customer can request for S$888 cash instead of 40k bonus. 2) Between 1 Jun 2014 to 31 May 2015, DBS Treasures customers who enrol in a Travel Program will earn 20% bonus Krisflyer miles (bonus mileage is based on distance travel). Interesting thing is that only ""G"" fare does not earn bonus, which means that some cheap economy tickets that does not qualify for Krisflyer miles can actually earn mileage on this program. http://www.singaporeair.com/jsp/cms/...privileges.jsp Anyone else who's signed up ???

I have only been upgraded twice and both at the gate before boarding.

" Originally posted by tfung View Post This would also make sense of get rid of LPPS, as existing LLPS members would probably get lifetime status in this super tier.. Originally posted by tfung View Post 1st one, which I personally think is most likely and makes the most sense, is that SQ would not change PPS Club as it is right now, but instead add a new unpublished tier like UA UGS or CX Diamond Plus program. However, this would eventually devalue PPS to the point that it'll become useless, like UA 1K. The benefit of doing this is that SQ will not upset too many of its existing customers (the ones who don't surf online looking for FF information all the time), as they would have no idea the new tier exists (you'd be surprised at how many UA mileage plus members have no clue that UGS exists). The benefit though is that they can focus more resources on this new group of people. The other benefit is that they would not need to publish a guideline on how this new super elite tier will be calculated and just say that it is by invitation only, and limit the number of people as they see fit (UA limits it to the top % of fliers by country and the $ amount varies year to year). A new elite tier level would again devalue further PPS. And yes, it would be business travellers with big budget travel would benefit from this new status. Originally posted by tfung View Post 2nd scenario would be that they might change it so that people in certain countries require more sectors to requalify. SIN and CGK based members might require 50 sectors to qualify, whereas other countries will remain at 25. This would be similar to what LH and BA does, which give different requirements depending on where you live. However, one concern will be people who change their address to bypass this, although I don't think it will be too many people outside of SQT, FT, etc.. I must say if this scenario is taken by SQ, may be the same qualification sectors across the world between 40 and 50 sectors, and reducing the sectors earned for such short-hauler SIN-CGK or other less than 999 miles. But again, it looks like SQ will go for the last scenario. Originally posted by tfung View Post Last scenario would be that they overhaul PPS completely using a revenue based system as talked about here by this thread. There will however be significant challenges in doing this. SQ will need to disclose how they calculate the revenue so that existing PPS members in order to minimize confusion. As mentioned, it will be difficult for SQ to calculate non SQ stock ticket revenue, RTW tickets, etc. Calculating ticket revenue is a black art that usually only airline account departments can decipher and there will be countless people who will complain that they were shortchanged by SQ, etc.. A lot of frequent travellers who fly on short haul routes will also not make the cut, and someone who only flies one F class roundtrip from the US a year might make it. It will be hard for SQ to justify someone who travels with them only once a year, is more valuable than someone who travels monthly between SIN-HKG in J. I predict if this model is indeed the one that SQ chooses, they will end up with a lot of PPS members based in the US and Europe, and very few left in Asia. It is also likely though, that they might introduce a combination of this scenario and the 2nd scenario, so that different country members will have different $ thresholds. The most probable mixed scenario would be a choice between the new enhanced PPS sectors and revenue based in order to qualify for PPS. But again, the strongest rumours is heading towards revenue based only. Hmm About 30 roundtrips CGK-SIN-CGK to qualify for PPS in a year. ",1

" Originally posted by jhm View Post It is also not ""dishonest"" to breach the KrisFlyer T&C. It's just a contract between two private entities (you and SQ). If you take the deliberate decision to break the contract, then there are consequences (e.g. cancellation of your KrisFlyer account; being sued and having to pay damages) but that has nothing at all to do with morality. I guess that view pretty much summarizes the difference between your view and mine, jhm. Breaching the T&C strikes me as a bizarre choice for escaping a commercial transaction. If, to join KrisFlyer, you indicate your willingness to abide by the T&C, then you can end the commercial relationship simply by leaving the program. I don't really find your example of the break penalty during an acquisition a compelling analogy. Companies can learn new information about a target in the course of an acquisition or their circumstances can change. What would be the analogous motivation for someone wanting to engage in behavior not allowed by the T&C? Let me reframe feb01mel's original question this way: 'If it is against T&C to sell your miles, and you join knowing that selling your miles will risk cancellation of your account although there is a chance you could escape detection, would you feel right about selling your miles?' Clearly, some people do. My answer is no, because doing so would, yes, be 'dishonest'. I would venture that for many people, ethical behavior (note: I didn't use the term 'morality' in my initial response) isn't about doing the right thing because the wrong thing can incur a legal / financial penalty; it's about doing the right thing because it's the right thing. This is why, in this example, I consider the distinction between criminal law and contract law irrelevant. For me, this isn't about the force of law. ",1

Just thought it was a bit odd cos the last time I encountered similar waitlist redemption for Seoul, the person on the phone offered to put in a request and i think a week later i got confirmation.

" Do SQ and QF recruit their staff from the same School of Bean Counting or what? Anyway this seems v reminiscent of the recent changes to QFF, except that there seems to be no option to offset the miles required with cash in this instance.

" Mileage Deals Spur Runs for Elite Status http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1239...moj_industries Mileage Deals Spur Runs for Elite Status If you ever wanted elite status on an airline, now's your chance. And if you're worried about losing your top-tier status because you've reduced business travel, there's a clever way to keep all those perks -- provided you've got some time to fly. The plunge in business travel has triggered a wealth of special frequent-flier program deals, from triple mileage on some routes to double elite-qualifying miles on all travel and huge bonuses for international trips. Play the promotions right and one trip can get you enough miles for a free domestic coach ticket plus elite status for a year. There's simply no better perk in commercial air travel today than having top-tier status with a major carrier. Elite-level travelers enjoy free upgrades; premium seating; no baggage fees; special check-in, security and boarding lines; early boarding privileges; and priority on standby lists. And elite fliers aren't the only ones who gain from these deals. Consumers who have seen the value of their miles decline as airlines raised the price of awards are regaining some buying power -- at least for the moment. Airlines say they are making more seats available for award redemptions, and some travel awards have even been put on sale. For example, tickets to Europe regularly priced at 55,000 miles were recently offered by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines for 40,000 miles. ""I can't remember a time like this,"" said Randy Petersen, president of Frequent Flyer Services, a Colorado Springs, Colo., publisher. ""Right now is one of the richest periods I've ever seen in 23 years of following these programs."" The promotions, most of which run until June 15, are so tempting and the fares are so cheap that some travelers are making ""mileage runs"" just to qualify and fill their mileage accounts. Jeff Schley found a way to vault to United's elite 1K status -- which requires that travelers log 100,000 miles annually -- with just one week of flying across the globe. Mr. Schley moved to Saudi Arabia last year to teach at an American school and did not have elite flier status. He left the Middle East on April 2 and flew to Washington, D.C., then on to Los Angeles, Sydney, San Francisco, Sydney, Los Angeles, Boston, Los Angeles, Washington and finally, back to Saudi Arabia. Over seven days, he spent 98 hours aboard airplanes, flying 52,000 miles. With United's double elite-qualifying miles offer, that earned him 1K status. Cost: $2,900. Rarely having to fly coach again: Priceless. ""Living overseas, travel is really a chore if you don't have status,"" said Mr. Schley. Since he'll earn bonus miles as an elite flier and his mileage run yielded an additional six coupons for an automatic upgrade good on any long-haul flight, Mr. Schley figures he'll be able to re-qualify easily and will be able to upgrade on most any flight in the future while he lives abroad. The flying itself -- entirely in coach -- was tedious. He wore compression socks to minimize the risk of blood clots forming in his legs, and used an eye shade, travel pillow and noise-canceling headset. An Australian customs agent who saw him entering the country twice in a few days quizzed him carefully on why he was staying only seven hours each time. And he grew tired of watching ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""Marley & Me"" over and over. ""I never would have done this without the double elite qualifying miles,"" he said. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines triggered the war over elite-qualifying miles in March, when it launched a double elite-qualifying-miles offer. Most U.S. airlines quickly matched the bonus. Elite-qualifying miles, or EQMs in the parlance of road warriors, are different from regular frequent-flier miles, which can be earned any number of ways, from credit-card purchases to restaurant dining as well as travel. EQMs are earned mostly by air travel alone, and are used by airlines to determine who gets granted special status in frequent-flier programs. Typically you need 25,000 EQMs each year for the lowest level of status, which grants a traveler early boarding and special security lines and possible upgrades. Usually 100,000 EQMs qualify travelers for top-tier status and better perks. Airlines say the bonus offers are designed to keep customers from switching to discount airlines during the recession. In past downturns, higher-fare carriers have lost market share to low-cost carriers. ""We don't want our best customers right now choosing another airline,"" said Jeff Robertson, Delta Air Lines' vice president of loyalty programs. The EQM bonuses have proven very popular. While American declined to discuss its elite-miles promotion, United says more than 50% of its elite-level frequent fliers have signed up for its mileage offer; Delta says one-third of its elite members have registered for its bonus promotion. Both airlines say customers are worried about re-qualifying since corporations have aggressively cut back on travel. Indeed, despite the offers, United projects it will have fewer elite-level members next year because of corporate travel cutbacks. ""This will certainly counteract some of the natural decline we're seeing, but it's not going to fully account for it,"" said Graham Atkinson, president of United's Mileage Plus frequent-flier program. Both Delta and United have put some frequent-flier awards on sale and seen consumers, anxious to use miles to travel these days instead of cash, snap them up. United saw a 40% increase in redemption activity when it cut the price of its trans-Atlantic ""saver"" award, the lowest-priced coach offering, Mr. Atkinson says. When Delta cut the price in miles on some of its frequent-flier awards, redemption activity jumped 25% the first day the new rates were loaded into computer systems -- before they were even advertised. Mr. Robertson said Delta plans big incentives on its credit-card deal with American Express Co. to help convince customers of Northwest, which Delta acquired, to switch credit cards. And airlines say more specials are likely on specific routes because of intense competition or just slow bookings, particularly when summer buying slows down. Smart mileage-runners take advantage of special situations. Fares to Australia, for example, are particularly cheap right now because incumbent airlines are battling a new start-up, V Australia, part of the Virgin Blue Group Ltd. Likewise, when JetBlue Airways Corp. began flying nonstop from Boston to Los Angeles, rivals struck back with a triple-mileage offer on the same route. Mr. Schley took advantage of both. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines offered tickets to Europe for 40,000 miles. For a one-day run, the cheap prices and triple-mile offer of the Boston-Los Angeles route is hard to beat. For $250 or so round-trip, you can earn more than 15,000 miles and more than 10,000 elite-qualifying miles. That can be a big boost to someone looking to top up a mileage account for award tickets or worried about re-qualifying for elite status. That's exactly what spurred Douglas Hardy of Detroit to buy a ticket to Singapore, with only enough time there for him to shower. Mr. Hardy, chairman of a real-estate company, isn't traveling for business as much as he used to, so he's worried about losing his Platinum Elite status on Northwest Airlines Corp., which has gotten him upgraded to first class on every flight he has been on since he reached the platinum level. ""I like the perks Platinum offers -- there's real value to it. But this year I'll be significantly short,"" he said. To avoid losing all that, Mr. Hardy paid $1,800 for a round-trip ticket from Detroit to Tokyo and on to Singapore in a couple of weeks. He'll spend less than five hours on the ground in Singapore. Mr. Hardy bought a coach ticket that he was able to upgrade using certificates he earned from Northwest, and flying in first class means he'll get triple elite-qualifying miles. For nearly 40 hours of flying in three days, he'll travel 19,436 miles. The triple elite-qualifying miles offer will give him more than 58,000 miles toward Northwest's platinum threshold of 75,000 EQMs. With other business and pleasure trips, he expects to re-qualify for platinum status through March 2011. ""I'm looking forward to it,"" he said. ""I think it'll be fun."" ",1

I am a MPC Gold for the last 2 years.

" There is also not much differences between Krisflyer Silver and Solitaire. There seems to be a lot of push for SQ to trim costs no matter how insignificant the cost incurring items are in the overall scheme of things. Unfortunately, most cost items bear no direct relationships to customer satisfaction including leather PPS luggage tag holder, good champagne in SKL F, birthday gifts etc. However, they do contribute to the overall image and overall service experiences. Previously, SQ have done well in Business Traveler AP survey (top) in every category, but noted the past two or three seasons have indicated that the category SQ has dropped to second is the Frequent Flyer Program with CX taking over the reins. The problem I do find with SQ are the cost cutting exercises are starting to show in various areas in absolute terms. It is sad indeed that the cost reduction exercises are still rolling on despite the drastic increase in margins and revenue. During a downturn, I guessed I will be more sympathetic on a need to reduce cost and keep staff employed but not when the profits are record levels. ",1

Both looked terrible in terms of presentation. One was covered in brown/red sauce of some sort (and I believe eggplant), and other was arranged into three 'farmer'-style rows in pale-yellow brown. I was very happy with the pre-booked seafood meal. Of course, they served it way in advance too.

" Hi and welcome; although it has been a few years since I made Solitaire, I believe your 'anniversary' date will be from when you first qualify for TPP i.e. when you spend the remaining $36k to make the quailfication. From then on the renewal will stay the same month with any extra spend going towards your 'reserve value' in case you do not spend $25k in any 12 month period. I have already qualified for another year although my anniversary date is Septemeber 2010. They will send out your new card a couple of months early and may even reset your value early so you can start to qualify again. But I am getting ahead of myself. I hope you qualify soon so you can enjoy the Solitaire benefits. Obviously the first class check in and lounge access and the quick clearing of WL flights are the main benefits I notice. But also the spare seat alongside you if the flight is not full and the personal attention on many (but not all) SQ flights. I only wish the seniority was better recognised across the rest of the Star Alliance. ",1

If it is the same one I visited the last time I was at PVG, I actually thought it wasn't too bad...

When I was there, I had the impression it was in between meal times, hence the lack of food. Other Air China lounges I have been to (Beijing, Chongqing etc) have all had food...not GREAT food, mind you, but something to fill the stomach... What I did appreciate was the full service bar. I thought the ambience and decor were fine too. I used that lounge on my recent return flight from PVG (Business class redemption), there were indeed showers which I used them before departure. They were pretty new. Just ask the attendant at the service counter inside the lounge on level 2 where the dining room is, you have to exchange your boarding pass for a key. ",0

" There are major lounge renovations works going on in Changi T3, with renovations ongoing at the original T3 Krisflyer Gold Lounge. In the mean time, Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold members have been directed to a temporary lounge, which is a shared space with the existing Marhaba Lounge, which has now been rebranded with a separate new Krisflyer Gold Lounge entrance. It must be tough being a lounge dragon at Changi these days. In the space of 3 minutes while I was at the lounge entrance, I observed the lounge staff at the Gold Lounge entrance directing business class pax to the SilverKris Lounge, as well as (politely) declining admission to a non-FF SQ premium economy flyer who thought she had access. I am sure the staff at the SilverKris Lounge also spend a lot of time directing Star Alliance flyers in economy over to this Gold Lounge as well. I visited the lounge at 8am yesterday, on a Sunday morning, and it was very busy. As fellow SQTalkers KC*, sqtrans, and davidfusq also mentioned in another thread, this lounge used to be the Marhaba Lounge, and is not large (Noticeably smaller than the previous T3 KF Gold Lounge). Seating area, with single-seater chairs, tables, as well as bar-style work tops... There is a long passageway with F&B laid out along one corridor... At the other end of the corridor, you reach another seating area, which turns out to be the seating area (and entrance) of the Marhaba Lounge. In other words, apart from separate entrances for Marhaba and Krisflyer Gold, this is the same lounge, with shared catering along the corridor and complete freedom of movement across the two areas. The fact that both entrances led to the same lounge sort of reminded me of this Simpsons cartoon ... It was a fairly bright and airy lounge, with decent views. ",0

" I am flying SIN - LAX in F next week on SQ12. I like lamb, so definitely want to book BTC for one of the legs. Have seen many reports for the Roast rack of lamb with mint jus, mesclun salad, and thyme-flavoured gratin potatoes which is available ex-SIN, so that definitely seems to be a good option. But how about the Crusted rack of lamb with yoghurt sauce and sautéed mixed vegetables which is available ex-NRT? Haven't seen any reports nor pictures. Has anybody tried it? Or even both? If so, what would you recommend? ",0

" Originally posted by VC10 Boy View Post Hello all. Im probably asking for the impossible here but would appreciate some thoughts. I currently have 906k Krisflyer miles and would like two F redemptions from LHR to SYD, return, at some point from September 2022 to August 2023, around three weeks apart. I know little enough about Krisflyer, but I do know enough to realise this is a big ask, if not impossible. And with only four seats on the 77W, well, really Id prefer suites on a 388 on all four legs. Is there any strategy I could look for? Booking a year out? Booking for one person and buying cash tickets for the second? If it helps I have zero status with SQ, other than Blue. I do have OW Emerald and *G but being Europe based, have little to no opportunity to fly SQ. Hello VC10 Boy! Happy New Year! Out of curiousity, I did a test booking for redemption tix, and Suites / F tix for 2, for these sectors, are actually available, although these are for Advantage rather than Saver bookings. Advantage requires significantly more points than Saver redemptions. For example, one way SIN-Europe F/Suites Saver is 125K points, whereas Advantage is 220K points. As an example, there was availability for 2 F tix LHR-SYD-LHR in Oct 2022 (One sector was in R, rest were F). That said, these are all Advantage bookings, which require many more points than Saver. Not sure of Saver availability. Would love to hear suggestions from others on how to secure Saver redemptions in F/Suites or J. ",1

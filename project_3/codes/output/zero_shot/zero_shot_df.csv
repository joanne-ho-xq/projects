This used to be even easier with the interline arrangement SQ used to have with him but didnt renew from mid 2007 onwards (why not SQ ). Also is the value for this segment pretty similar for say SIN - LON , or SIN - MAN. cheers guys Token Isn't it PPS Value based on the whole itinerary in the ticket?

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post Disagree. PPS Value is actually a decision I strongly support. From an airline point of view, you want to pamper those customers who make the most money - showing up 200 times for the cheapest eco fare on SIN-BKK and then expect special treatment... Why? Another reason is that qualification by miles is a very variable income: In times where fares are high, SQ makes a lot of money - with the current promos, making it to PPS would be only half the revenue for them. We agree on the benefits part then. Now... who said anything about giving PPS to those flying purely Y?? Not me. But I do say 25-35 sectors in F or J is a better way to reward loyalty. It's not the pax fault if the global economy crashes and SQ has to cut fares. What you are suggesting is that the loyal customer that regularly does 3 longhaul trips a year in J, qualified under the old 25 sectors rule, and qualified under the $25k PPSV rule, now deserves to LOSE QPP or TPP because cheaper fares don't add up to $25k??? I think not. IMHO this is another major (previously unforeseen) flaw in the PPSV system. Loyalty is loyalty, whether fares are high or low, and it should be appropriately rewarded.

Even at that time, some East Asian carriers were already giving miles for all classes to mirror the pattern set by American carriers.

" Okay, let me try to clarify. This post is dedicated to both of you, dearest SQ LPP and Sqstalker: Yes, from what I have heard, some of the wines they served in First Class was F.O.C. to the airline in exchange for the publicity received in the air. Originally posted by SQ LPP But who can afford giving out $150 wine for each flight for the whole year? I would be so surprise if the winery does that. How can it survives financially? As to how long the deal was, how can the chateau survive giving away (so much) free products, and the economic impact to the chateau itself: I have no information about those. For example, if it was a limited time, it may be manageable for the chateau. Another possibility is that they negotiated with the chateau AFTER the selection by the wine panel is finalized. Another thing to note is that a USD150 bottle of wine is only a USD150 bottle of wine to you (the customer), but not the chateau. But fact is it was done and perhaps is still being done. Do realize, from the beginning I did not say that it is a negative thing about SQ. Both of you made it seems like it is a very negative issue & cost cutting etc., which I don't understand why.

" Originally posted by carhartt79 View Post Hi all I'm new in this forum and have enjoyed reading all the blogs and post. I have an inquiry here with regards to KF Renewal. Currently, I'm in Elite Silver expiring on 30 June 2016. I have re-qualified for this as I have amassed 25,567 miles and I noticed by Gold qualification is currently 31,315, in which I need another 18,685 miles to qualify by 31 May 2016. The question I have is, will all these 31k miles be wiped out upon my Silver renewal in July. I have a potential 13k miles as I will be travelling to Azerbaijan on *Alliance in June. I do not want to credit them in and realize that this will be wiped out instantly. Your wise response on my predicament is greatly appreciated. Thank you Hi carhartt79! Welcome to SQTalk! For Elite qualification the counter is reset every 12 months, with the exact month depending on when you joined Krisflyer. In your case, it looks like your period for requalification ends on 31 May 2016. So if you want to hit Gold, you must deposit those miles and reach 50K qualification miles before 31 May 2016, otherwise you will start from zero from a qualification perspective. If you deposit them after 31 May, then they will count for next year's qualfication period, not the current year. Note that the elite qualification miles are not ""wiped out"" in that they are never deducted -- they will remain in your account for your redemption. Only the counter for elite qualification is reset to 0. The miles are still yours. Hope this info helps!

Result is lower yield which means less money to spend to keep the premium cabins premium - a vicious spiral. I agree with Kiwi on this. I have only been upgraded twice and both at the gate before boarding. And I believe it was due to the overselling of economy class seats, not because they have spare seats in business/first class and wanted to give out as rewards to Gold/PPS members. I personally have no issue with the way SQ is handling. If my ticket is meant for economy, I expect a economy seat. If I wanted more, I either redeem or pay for it.

They scribbled on my BP as they had run out of lounge invites. One thing they did have at checkin was a nice young lady representing Illy Cafe who was trying to persuade people to choose their place when given the four choices on offer. In fairness, with the deterioration of the lounge (which is down to SASCO's greed) I think it's pretty good of SQ to give us four different options to choose from. I agree with MAN in that SQ are trying their best to provide a fair level of service in spite of the SASCO fiasco. I keep on asking for an email address for the SASCO General Director so that we can bombard him (or her). My practice now is to take the lounge invitation and go first to the Singapore restaurant on my own Dong. The food is not bad and the WiFi faster than the lounge.

" Originally posted by sudsoz View Post But I do think that if your activity is going to generate gold or other elite status then there is something to be said for doing that with an airline I am going to actually travel with from time to time. The advantages of a remote airlines program would have to be pretty good to overcome the benefits of having status with the airline you are actually travelling with often. Totally agree with that sentiment. It's a fine balancing act - generous earn/burn vs status benefits. Hence ""Which FFP?"" threads surface from time to time on here, and inspire so much passionate debate. More factors to consider when the FFP on the carrier one actually flies most often has significant benefits specific to that carrier, as opposed to general alliance wide benefits. Most of my flying is done on QF these days (by choice ) and status on QFF would bring significant benefits flying on QF, both official and unpublished. However when I took time to consider what I'd deem my fundamental priorities in an FFP (premium class award tickets, some form of lounge access and avoiding queues) vs what I'd consider nice but not essential (benefits over and above the basic alliance wide benes), the much more generous earn/burn ratio that AAdvantage offers is more than sufficient to outweigh the metaphorically bigger smile I'd get from QF as a QFF elite. I also get to fly on AA a few times a year to be able to use the AA-specific benes I'd derive from AAdvantage status, so it's not all ""wasted."" Of course this may change in the years ahead when I cease having time to use miles and instead find some of the QFF benes attractive. I considered the same thing when I flew Star, back in the good ol days of PPS sectors and I simply did the double dip with LH M&M. bmi wasn't open to people outside Europe when I joined M&M and I didn't want to bother with forwarding mail. Like you I too found it hard to work out NZ's system and also been advised that their earn/burn isn't that great anyway, though pretty easy elite status and generous perks from what I can tell.

 One trick for children under 12 is to use the miles redemption on the adults and pay cash for the child as child tickets cost 75% or 70% of adult ticket if there is insufficient miles for the entire family. Also if I'm not wrong finding 3 saver redemptions may not be easy. Do workout the final overall cost and value that best suits your needs and budget.

I don't say this to boast - it's nearly all paid for by my employer. Just wondering whether you guys have to balance family with work like this. Don't get me wrong, I feel lucky that over 90% of my travel is on SQ in J or F. Having travelled on NZ, UA, AC, QF, Southwest, TG, CX this year I'm under no illusion about SQ's superiority. It's simply the work/life balance of spending 120-150 night per year away from home that bothers me a bit. Wonderful to have a supportive wife but is it really worth all the mileage and hotel points? Interested to hear your thoughts. Very good post and something I often think about - more often than not when travelling, or in a hotel of an evening. Achieving a healthy work/life balance is not easy - that said it's a choice you have to make... I was travelling heavy in a global role (mostly Asia Pacific) before I married, luckily thereafter my wife and I can manage this and make it work to our advantage. But at times it can be tough... I keep saying within 2 years I will cut down or stop my current travelling schedule, but after 12 years I am still doing the same. Personally travel time is sacred because it is my time to switch off from work. I have a rule to never work when I fly, rather I always read, listen to music, watch a movie or TV, or sleep. This is a reason why I am so particular about how I travel, therefore personal space, privacy, and exceptional service are important factors to me.

Revisions to Saver Award levels in the Singapore Airlines and SilkAir Award Chart have been made to ensure that flight rewards remain sustainable yet competitive. We last made adjustments to award levels in various zones in 2012. The 15% discount for redemption and redemption upgrade bookings made through singaporeair.com and the SingaporeAir app will be discontinued, and the same redemption fare will be applied across all channels. Fuel and insurance surcharges from all redemption award tickets on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir operated flights will be removed. View the Revised Award Chart, effective from 23 March 2017 View the Current Award Chart Importantly, with this change, while there will be an increase in the number of miles required to redeem for flights in certain zones, you can also expect to enjoy savings in the amount of cash you would need to pay for your redemption ticket due to the removal of fuel and insurance surcharges.

" Just an intermediate update. Called PPS line in SIN -> transferred to Krisflyer -> transferred to PPS specialist at Krisflyer. At all three levels, the initial dismissive responses ranged from ""Sir, PPSV is the fare less taxes and fees..."", or ""it's a formula"", or ""you don't earn PPSV for economy"". It was only after I made it clear that I knew the exact fares paid and fare classes, and offered to quote them the ticket numbers did they bother to take this seriously. Anyway, after being put on hold for some time, they did acknowledge that an error was made, and her case has been sent to Krisflyer Membership Services for a manual retroactive change. Was advised that this can take weeks. I am still not convinced that they will get the correct amount. The last guy I spoke to eventually agreed that the o/w E->C fare difference (S$2243) should clearly be credited as PPSV, but he seemed to fudge whether half of the original r/t E fare ($807) should also count.

" Separated this into a thread of it's own to save it getting lost in the main one. I have to say the way SQ have or are handling this is farcical. First of all I was told the same as Cruiser Elite, that Changi (the airport itself) had removed the screens, which never made any sense from the off. The second and third times I was in there the reply was it was 'a management decision'. However, having filled in a complaint form on the original visit I finally got an official reply a few weeks ago and this is some of it: The monitors were removed because we wanted our lounge staff to provide a more personalised service to our TPR passengers. Lounge staff in TPR approach passengers personally when flight is boarding or if there is a gate change or delay unlike other sections of the lounge where passengers have to find a screen to check on flight details. In the recent upgrading exercise, we felt that the screen can be removed as our lounge staff are communicating the flight information personally to passengers. We have briefed our staff to be vigilant and proactive if they see passengers roaming around where the screens used to be. OK, that's pretty clear but you really do have to ask why they were told to tell us lies about it initially ?!. If they are doing this new personalised service, and they clearly are from my recent experience, why not just tell us this instead of telling outright lies that 'Changi have taken them down' On the subject itself, I remain bemused by the decision and think its wrong. It's all well and good saying they will remember where everyone in there is flying, and that's been easy last few visits when it's been dead. But that's a tricky one to keep up when it's full during the large early and late banks of departures each day. The closest screens now are back in the corridor just after the SKL J lounge, which is quite a trek from TPR and means you either leave your belongings there and walk there and back or pack everything up while you walk there and back. I think the fact they initially blatantly lied bout the reason they had gone shows some people involved in this are not convinced by it either...

From what I have been reading here it seems that that is quite likely, seeing that even CGK is thinking of saying ""good-bye and I'll miss you"" to PPS at the end of 2007.[/QUOTE] I agree 10 or more sectors would be a heavy burden for FF esp. those who pay for PPS out of their own pocket I was hoping an extra 5 (seems reasonable) if going to raise at all.

Well everything is back to what you are looking for. Definitely if you spend your time in South East Asia, I would eat the local dishes in the local restaurant to enjoy the most. And I will not be too worry about the food on board my flight. I generally pick asian dishes because I prefer that than the western food. I did venture to gnocchi, pappardelle etc, but it did not set well with me. One time I modified my own meals on board SQ. I had rack of lamb. The crew had cut chilli and I had my tiny bottle sweet soya sauce. Had mix those as well as the onions from the satay... and yes I had rack of lamb marinated with chilli sweet soya sauce like an Indonesian satay.

So far for me, it has been worth it. When I am flying in Y, from check in to boarding, it has been a breeze. Mention PPS, the check in counter person suddenly becomes more attentive. Requesting for seats get better attention, they will try their utmost best to get me the seat I wanted. More often then not, when flight is not full, seat next to me is empty. Sometimes, not always, on Y flights I get meals served first, FA will come to me to ensure that I get the meal of my choice. Of course there is the discount on duty free at Changi and in flight. I will always buy oxygen sticks on departure from Changi and I get the discount. Not to mention having SKL access in Changi, which is a plus too. For SQ wait list, I always get cleared. My TA will confidently issue ticket on waitlisted sectors for me. Never had once I was not cleared on waitlisted seat. Further, I am always assigned to my preferred seat, even though I was on wait list previously. However, if you only fly on J and F, PPS or not, makes not difference.

Something did need to be done, but a lounge extension would have cost a fraction of what revenues they'll initially lose with those who don't bother chasing PPS now.

Else they'll deny me boarding until someone takes the responsibility for me. (Worst case scenario according to agent) [Think it is their regulations] That's the answer that I have received from the agent who had called JFK Station Manager. UM Waiver signed in Singapore Office is of no use. That's why they needed to find a new booking for me urgently - who will accept a minor and no transfer in terminals. I'm 16YO and SQ just changed their policy for UM to <18. Heard that they escalated my case to some other higher department. I'm not expecting cash compensation but meanwhile, my 'compensation' is being able to take EWR-SIN on A345 metal. I'll fly from YYZ-EWR-SIN-MEL (No terminal change). However, they still need to check with EWR if i can transit by myself in the same airport. (Transit time is only 3hrs.) The thing is SQ made a mistake by issuing this eticket knowing that I can't transit by myself as a minor in the states airport.

In response to Lingua101, yes I think they shud make an exception,I have spent an obscene amount of money with SQ for 22 years,I had averaged over 120,000 Sing dollars a year with them, and that doesnot count the air freight I filled their planes with every week, Now I checked my record as I was just renewed again ,last year was over 40,000 sing dollars, so even with cutting a lot of flights away from them , I still spend a fair amount with them, and after they have numerous cut backs 1- no more gifts or annual party 2- doublng redeemention miles 3-cut back on quality of food and service on the flights 4-doing away with life members to just name a few one extra guest is not asking a lot.

" Originally posted by SkySuites View Post Hi EWR and SMK77 I plan to use my miles on TG for SYD-FCO trip in June - TG are normally quite good at releasing O class seats and I've found their First with only 10 seats on their 744s to be superb - I know TG service is more traditional and maybe not as refined as SQ but it is still a great First product. As to writing a letter to Mr Seng I have thought about it and I think I might just do that and let them know not only about my experience with this booking but how it is beyond absurd their protectionist and elitist attitude towards their Suites which frankly are becoming a 'white elephant'. My profession is Aviation Consultant specifically on airline product and planning - the strategy SQ has adopted for the A380/77W in their Premium cabins in terms of pricing and frequent flyer redemption is now largely working against them. Hopefully Mr Seng will reply but I am not holding my breath... Will keep you guys posted... Cheers. In Singapore, the best way to get a response is to write to the local presses. This will be read by the various stakeholders. Although I am not sure if you like to mention that you are an Aviation Consultant as this may affect your future biz.

" Sadly you're absolutely right, fimo. PPS is not worth anyone going out of their way for these days, and I can't see why TPP would be either. They may claim it's '**** *********' but in fact it's a vastly reduced benefits club. TPP is the same. We have also had anytime lounge access taken away and not content with vastly reduced numbers in the SKL F side, they saw the need to drastically downgrade the champagne served there. This means it is exactly the same as the Raffles side now, where anybody taking their first ever flight in Raffles is also given access to. How very exclusive.. As for the waitlist situation, while it may well change when the numbers start dropping off over the next few years, at the moment being TPP has made no difference to QPP for clearing in my limited experience.

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post A slightly strange way of looking at the situation. SQ have a lounge in KUL as it is one of the largest/busiest markets with a large number of pax going through there per week, many with status. By your logic why have a lounge anywhere outside SIN as almost every flight ends up there?. The length of the flight dictates what is served on board, which in the case of KUL is virtually nothing. NRT is a *A hub and they must deem the NH lounge to be decent enough, unlike TG's lounges at BKK. Until quite recently SQ really either didn't 'get' lounges or the old arrogance of thinking they were alone on a high pedestal meant they didn't need to bother as most were generally poor. The fame of the old SKL F at T2 years ago was only on the back of them serving Dom or Krug in there, and that got royally abused by many people (including a few long standing members of this place ) buying an F ticket to KUL (ironically) or the old system of PPS sectors, and thus much easier to qualify, and the PPS programme previously allowing QPP's in J access to the SKL F. Ah I see your point there on the volume and quality of partner lounges offered. That makes sense.

" Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post The different membership month plus using current year PPSV instead of lifetime cumulative PPSV actually has the overall benefit of introducing some randomness to the whole op-up game. Yes, I realized about the randomness in this op-up. But still, if someone determines to rack the PPS values at the beginning of monts of requalification, it will give this person a bit of advantage. Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post Are you sure it's based on tier and then PPSV, as opposed to just PPSV? Yes, it is based on TIER first. If in the TIER there are more than one, PPS value will determine the rank. Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post If op-ups are based on cumulative PPSV, LPPs will more likely 'win', thus rendering op-ups an expected entitlement for them and dis-incenting others. And since LPPs don't have to worry about requalifying, they could then buy cheap Y fares and hope for an op-up. No cumulative PPS V used. And BTW, for LPP, the cumulative PPS Value is zero. Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post If op-ups are based on current year PPSV, any PPS, depending on their travel pattern and their luck - their membership month relative to other PPS' membership month on that flight on that particular day - may have a chance at that elusive op-up once in a blue moon. It's certainly better in terms of customer delight for SQ to spread the wealth around, as rare an occurrence as it is, than keep handing out op-ups to LPPs. Again, op-up is not common. There is always a way to lure other pax to take the next flight or the next day. So, it's not always happened that SQ needs to do op-up. Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post But if it's based on tier and then PPSV, then LPPs on cheap Y fare will still trump TPPs & QPPs on full fare, which is a bit inconsistent with SQ's focus on awarding current premium passengers rather than legacy. I think it depends on the route. It seems that when I am taking Y, I am the only LPP, and the flights were not overbooked in Y. I heard that most LPP still flies on C at least. And remember that the LPPs are inclusive of the supplementary card holders as well. Talking to some SQ staff regarding my supplement card, they suggested to me to give it to someone who flies Y mostly, since it will be more beneficial or the most advantage that can be expected.

" This should clear some doubts I have accumulated more than SGD 25,000 PPS Value before my Membership expiry date. Can I renew my membership early? The mechanism for renewal has not changed. The renewal criteria for PPS Club membership is a PPS Value of at least S$25,000 within the membership year. Membership will only be renewed at the end of the membership year. Also, the PPS Value that is in excess of S$25,000 does not count towards membership renewal in the next membership year. My cumulative PPS miles and sectors were converted to cumulative PPS Value on 1 September 07. Is this tracked as my first year for the count of 5 consecutive years for Solitaire membership ? Your current membership year as on 1 September07 is counted as your first year in the count of maximum 5 consecutive years. The cumulative PPS Value you have in the next 4 uninterrupted PPS Club membership years will be tracked for Solitaire membership qualification. As soon as you have a cumulative PPS Value of S$250,000 within these 5 consecutive years, your membership will be upgraded to Solitaire. I have re-qualified for PPS Club membership based on the old PPS Miles or PPS sector criteria before 1 Sept 2007 in my current membership year. How do I know if indeed my membership will be renewed for another year?All you need to do is log in at My Account and click on Statements. The row marked Additional PPS Value required for PPS Club requalification should not appear in your statement. I have re-qualified for Solitaire PPS Club membership based on the old PPS Miles or PPS sector criteria before 1 Sept 2007 in my current membership year. How do I know if indeed my membership will be renewed for another year? All you need to do is log in at My Account and click on Statements. The row marked Additional PPS Value required for Solitaire PPS Club requalification should not appear in your statement. What is the Current PPS Club membership valid until Date? The PPS Club membership period (for all tiers) is for 12 months, and the count for renewal of membership starts from the 1st full month from qualification or upgrade. For example, if you qualify on 14 October 2007, your PPS Club membership will start immediately. However, the count for renewal will for 12 months starting from 1 November 2007; your current membership year will be valid to 31 October 2008. The same principle applies for an upgrade of tier. Upgrade takes effect immediately and a new membership period/year begins. For example, if your current PPS Club membership expiry date is 31 October 2009, but you qualified for Solitaire membership in July 2009, your new PPS qualification expiry date will be 31 Jul 2010. Why is the expiry date on my membership card different from my membership expiry date when I check my account online? A PPS Club membership period is for 12 months and that is reflected in your account statement. The expiry date on your membership card is 1 month after the end of your membership period so that you will not be inconvenienced by holding an expired card before a new one is received. You will continue to enjoy the privileges of PPS Club membership for 1 month after the end of your current membership period/year. http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...ps_member.jsp?

" In KL again last week, and visited the Silver Kris Lounge in KL. How I ended up there might actually be more interesting than the lounge itself . I was on an MH ticket, but my KUL-SIN sector was a codeshare with Silkair. My business meetings in KL took place the day before. I had a couple of late conference calls in the evening, which meant I had to stay the night, before heading back to SIN the next day. I chose a slothful 11.10am departure from KUL to SIN, which meant that I could wake up at a reasonable hour, then head from the Hilton Kuala Lumpur at KL Sentral to the airport for a quick brekkie before my flight home. A quick ride on the KLIA Express got me to the airport without any fuss. As my MH codeshare ticket was operated my Silkair, I could not check in at the MAS counters at KL Sentral -- I had to head to the Silkair check-in counters at KLIA itself. After picking up my boarding pass, I was on auto-pilot and headed straight into the airside area, to the new dedicated ASEAN immigration counters. This must be one of the greatest features at KLIA! The few times I have been there since this was implemented, the other non-Malaysia queues on arrival and departure were busy, but the ASEAN lanes were free. Thumbs up! But just as I got the queue I realized that I had not yet had breakfast... As I was still in that ""no man's land"" after the departure boarding pass check, and before the immigration counters, I figured I could still go back outside. I headed to the lift (escalators there only go down...) and went up one level back to the landside area. The airport security staffer checking boarding passes was surprised to see me come up the lift, as pax traffic was practically all headed the other way: down the escalator to immigration. ""Can I go outside? I want to eat breakfast before I go in."" ""There is food inside,"" she replied. ""Yes, but I want to eat Roti Canai in the Food Garden.""... She looked confused for a moment, then motioned for me to head out back to the airside departure area... ""Don't they have roti canai in Singapore?"" she must have been thinking... Ironically once I headed to the Food Garden on Level 2, I could not find the roti canai. The stall had either closed in the last 2 weeks, or was now preparing the lunch menu, with other dishes. No roti canai in sight! I went back up to the departure level and headed airside. I would have to eat breakfast in one of the lounges...

The booking process was pretty painless - I just called KF and they did the booking. They said they would get back to me when the booking was confirmed by Virgin. After a few days of waiting I contacted them to be told the booking was confirmed. I had checked the online prices of Virgin before deciding it was worth to use the 50,000 miles required and hence decided to proceed. I could also see that online Virgin's fare breakdown calculated GBP 217 for Taxes, Surcharges, Airline charges etc. A detailed breakdown is available online from their website. Therefore I was surprised when KF told me the taxes and surcharges would be S$840 (which is about GBP 400). Obviously I queried this and the very friendly lady told me she would check with her supervisor. Shortly afterwards I received a call back to tell me the charges were correct and that taxes and surcharges would be different if booked with the airline direct. As these taxes and surcharges are clearly spelled out, I wonder how there can be such a huge difference in the cost between KF and Virgin. As the Virgin all in on line fare is only GBP 700 it seems a waste to use 50,000 miles to save GBP 300, so I will likely not bother with the redemption. However, I can't help but feel SQ is trying to cheat me. Any insights from anyone ? Cheers Neil ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.7825570106506348, 0.21744301915168762]",krisflyer

 A few interesting tidbits (no pun intended) in this article about SQ catering. eg SQ is the second largest buyer of Dom Perignon in the world & an F meal costs double a J meal which in turn costs double a Y meal.

" Actually UA/AC DO fly to Australia! They fly DAILY SFO-SYD and LAX-SYD on the 744 with one of the 744's in addition makes a daily round-trip SYD-MEL while in Australia. Note that due to bilateral rights between Oz/US you CANNOT book the daily SYD-MEL sector separately and must be booked in addition to a trans-pacific flight (you must route SFO-SYD-MEL or LAX-SYD-MEL) on UA/*A or YVR-SYD-MEL I believe on AC/UA. Air Canada ALSO files DAILY to Oz now with daily YVR (Vancouver)-SYD (Sydney) flights that start in YYZ (Toronto, same B77L actually, first part is domestic sector). They also fly to SIN daily with the continuation of YYZ/YVR/YYC/SFO/LAX/ORD/IAD-NRT-SIN and/or YYZ/YVR/SFO/ORD-HKG-SIN. Note that there will be some scheduled aircraft swaps soon but you will be protected as long as you have booked. This is FAR LONGER as it routes via East Asia versus the non-stop North America West Coast/Australia/NZ non-stops that go south-west versus west THAN south. The fastest way to Oz on UA/AC/*A from North America is either the following from YYZ: YYZ-LAX/SFO-SYD-MEL on UA completely YYZ-YVR-SYD-MEL on UA/AC. Note that ONLY Qantas flies non-stop from MEL to North America with the LAX-MEL DAILY with 4 of them weekly being an A380 the rest a 744ER. MEL is just too far from West Coast North America for a standard 744 to run full-payload and must run with a 777/A340/A380 or Qantas special 744ER they bought to run this sector. You shouldn't have cancelled YYZ-SFO. Though UA doesn't have PTV's on their 744's on their SFO/LAX-SYD/MEL sectors unfortunately. If I were you I would just book Air Canada AC33 DAILY YYZ-YVR-SYD with UA SYD-MEL or buy a tag-on on QF or Jetstar or whatever LCC is in Oz at the moment. Note that due to competition and increased tourism/BUSINESS between Oceania and North America the FLIGHTS NON-STOP between Oz and USA/Canada and REALLY FULL at the moment and the companies are charging SKY-HIGH fares (Like Air Canada's $1500-$2000 YYZ-YVR-SYD and AC is making good profits with the B77L DAILY now!). You can also route via NZ with ANZ flying YVR-AKL 2x/weekly and SFO-AKL 5x/weekly (744) and LAX-AKL 2x daily (one of which continues on-to London via the Western hemisphere, aka USA/Canada). The ONLY reason and the popularity of going the long way ALL the way to East Asia transiting to Oceania is because of CHEAPER FARES. Even though competition has increased on LAX/SFO/YVR-SYD/AKL/MEL/BNE non-stops it's still capacity constrained. That's why QF is flying the A380 MEL/SYD-LAX non-stop and 4x weekly DFW-BNE-SYD (reverse is non-stop due to head-winds, this may switch to an A380 soon). Los Angeles-Melbourne non-stop is 15 hours IIRC. If you want the absolute FASTEST routing time-wise it would be with OneWorld QF/AA of YYZ-LAX-MEL and reverse. If you want to skip the USA transfer and do direct Canada-Australia you can fly AC33/34 which runs YYZ-YVR-SYD daily and buy a separate or combined PNR on-to MEL. Or go via NZ and do YYZ-YVR-AKL-MEL.

" Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post My experience as QPP proved to me just how targeted the program is. Not all people who can achieve PPS will appreciate PPS benefits. So there isn't a guaranteed seat availability privilege. The near-miraculous waitlist-clearing capability of PPS status takes care of that. I found, to my pleasant surprise, that this holds for award seats as well. I was able to get award seats confirmed on the LHR-SIN route during the busy Christmas season. The confirmation more than made up for the period spent waiting for the waitlist to clear. Op-ups? That has never been SQ's policy, so it's a phantom comparison. If you really like the random upgrades enough to strategize about them, then SQ isn't the right airline for you. Fit the profile of the targeted segment, however, and PPS is a fantastic status to enjoy. My best long-haul Y experiences on SQ have been as a QPP, because the crew took the steps to make my flights extra special. Flying in J, I thought it was actually good that PPS made no difference. That meant those who could gun for PPS would have a great experience to recall when decision time came. Besides, PPS members in J would've obtained a headstart on the champagne, courtesy of their lounge privileges (if they were travelling from SIN). Well said! - my experiences have echoed yours closely. To me, the most important PPS benefit is the consistent ease of clearing waitlists, which comes in very handy, indeed. When traveling on SQ Y, I, too, have noticed extra attention from and proactive measures by the crew, as if they're overcompensating to make sure I enjoy my Y flight. (BTW, when flying in Y, I don't expect as much and am low-maintenance, but I definitely notice all the little touches.) I agree that op-ups are just not part of SQ's corporate strategy or practice, and the rarity of them underscores SQ's yield & inventory management excellence and fiscal responsibility. (Of course, I am delighted when, on the rare occasion, I get an op up, but I don't expect it and am not upset if I don't get more than I paid for, especially when I see Solitaire PPS passengers sitting across from me in the same Y seats.) Depending on how high SQ raises their PPS bar, I may not requalify after this year and will re-evaluate my loyalty once I can measure my level of travel vs. the requalification criteria. I will probably try to fly PPS whenever practical but won't go out of my way to do so. However, no matter what, SQ will still have a very consistently high standard of service. I was discussing the impending potential PPS cutbacks with my friend who used to be CX Gold/Diamond for many years before switching to SQ last year. He just flew on CX J r/t last week and told me, ""It's just not the same. I was disappointed with their service; they don't seem as friendly or caring as much anymore after all my SQ flights.""

" I decided to go down the OZ route. 40k in two years gives two years *G. I was wary of A3 because of word of mergers and possible FFP changes. Plus 40k over two years seems easier than 20k in one year in case flying patters are unpredictable. Plan is to credit to OZ until I hit the 40k, then credit the remaining miles in the 2 year qualifying window to KF. Once the next 2 year qualifying window starts, I'll start crediting to OZ again. That way, I'm effectively paying a 20k/year tax for *G status (lounge access, extra baggage, and better chances in the event of missed connections are the key features for me). Hopefully in good years, I'll make a reasonable KF balance, in lean years, I'll at least have *G. If only BD were sticking around, I might try harder to stay with them; best FFP by far!

" Guys, I don't work for SQ. I was mere trying to rationalize why SQ might be integrating the lounges as SQJunkie posted, my assumption being that SQ knows what they're doing! How would you explain why they'd want to integrate the lounges then? That would be a rather strange marketing perspective to adopt. Why would the SKL be the brand that is being optimized? The relevant brands are SQ First Class, SQ Business Class and SQ Economy Class. Isn't the lounge experience a very integral part of the premium cabin travel experience? If I were SQ, I would want SKL to be a very strong brand that travelers would identify with well. What a strange line of logic. So are we saying it's a good thing if I travel in F and always know that I can expect the same lounge I can get when I travel in J? Even though I might have paid considerably more for the ticket? And even though J lounge often gets extremely crowded due to the higher number of J and status pax so it would be a distinctly less desirable atmosphere? Yes that's the downside I thought about too. It would be a downgrade for those flying in F. ButSurely this wouldn't be for Changi where the F lounge is spectacular with its specialised sub-lounge with an a la carte menu, The Private Room. I have only been to the T2 and T3 Changi ones, never been to the overseas ones so you tell me. Beyond how crowded it is, is there a distinction between the F and J lounges? Like in terms the food or amenities? I meant to say that if there isn't really much of a difference between the F and J lounges, wouldn't it be nicer to have one big lounge instead?

" Thanks for the welcome Desert Traveller. You're right it is a rant and a furious one too. Guy Betsy: ""That is not correct. When you purchase the ticket, there is link that shows you the fare rules and the fare basis. The first letter of the fare basis usually indicates the booking class. If you see a Hxxxx, you will therefore know that the fare has a H booking class and that you cannot upgrade using this fare. You have this option BEFORE you purchase the ticket."" You're right I had the option before I booked the ticket and I booked the ticket as a flexi ticket which a considerable amount more then the flexi saver for obvious reasons. I knew I can upgrade with this ticket hence I bought it. SQueeze: ""E-tickets show booking class: E,B,H,D,A etc The itinerary sent to email after booking shows cabin class only (Y,F) If one purchases tickets online, when you hover over the prices, they clearly indicate whether they are miles-earning or not, upgrade-able or not. Flexi savers earns miles, but not upgrade-able, flexi earns miles and upgradable. I don't see how it can be made clearer during the booking process."" That is as easy as it should be. Even now when I go through the process of booking a ticket it gives you the options of a flexi saver and flexi. When I bought my tickets I bought the flexi tickets which should be upgradeable and it also showed the Y economy on eticket receipt but when I tried upgrading with my miles they said I was booked in S & E. SilverChris: ""Have you tried pointing this out to SQ directly?"" Yes, I raised it with SQ and they still insist that I was booked in S & E I even asked them to send me their receipt of my ticket but to this day nothing yet.

" Luke, I understood the rules slightly differently. As I would never be in a position to take advantage of the requal averaging method , my understanding is probably flawed. I understood averaging to have the following features: 1. SQ checks for excess sectors at the end of the 9th month of your requal year 2. If you've earned more than the required 25 sectors in the previous year, then they average your total sectors over the past two requal years ([previous requal year + 9 months of current requal year] divided by two) and requalify you if the average is at or above 25. 3. At that point, your QPP count goes up by one; your sectors reset to zero; and you'll have, in effect, fifteen months to requalify (the last 3 months of this requal year plus the usual 12 months of your actual requal year). 4. Rinse and repeat In sfvoyage's example, it depends on whether he had excess sectors in his first year (non-QPP --> QPP1). Then as you point out, at the 9 month-mark in September, the averaging method will push him up to QPP2. (That is, unless fimo's experience was a foreshadowing of a new policy.) It's likely I misunderstood the rules, so I await clarification from other SQ experts.

Dom Pérignon Vintage 2004 Suites and First Class customers will now be greeted with Dom Périgon Vintage 2004 as a welcome drink. Nuanced and precise, the 2004 vintage is the natural sum of perfectly consistent parts. The 2004 vintage leaves its mark on the history of Dom Pérignon for its ease and generosity. Aromas of almond and powdered cocoa develop gradually into white fruit with hints of dried flowers. Classic toasted notes give a rounded finish and denote a fully realised maturity. On the palate, the wine instantly traces an astoundingly fine line between density and weightlessness. Its precision is extreme, tactile, dark and chiselled. The full taste lingers with the utmost elegance on a sappy, spicy note. Singapore Airlines is pleased to offer the highly acclaimed Dom Pérignon Vintage 2004 in addition to the prestigious Krug Champagne. Salvatore Ferragamo Kits in Suites and First Class From May onwards, customers travelling in Suites and First Class can experience a new gender-specific amenities kit specially designed by Salvatore Ferragamo and exclusive to Singapore Airlines. Each kit includes a 30 ml Eau de Toilette, a cleansing towel, lip balm and hand cream. The male kit features the Acqua Essenziale Eau de Toilette, a fresh fragrance inspired by water, while the female kit carries the Eau de Toilette Signorina, a fragrance celebrating the most joyous facet of a chic and glamorous young lady. Singapore Airlines is the first airline to feature these two elegant fragrances by Salvatore Ferragamo onboard. Got that e-mail for PPS club last week. Seems like the Ferragamo kits are back and usually the SIN-NRT-LAX route gets new products faster than other route. Not sure why.

" Originally posted by demue View Post Wow Economy Saver award booking privileges to folks who qualify flying premium cabin Guess you are supposed to be reminded of how it feels in the back of the bus Now change that Business Saver and you are talking actual tangible benefits. Indeed. SQ have a 'loyalty' programme for which you can only obtain status by flying in Premium Cabins, and they are hard faced enough to then promote one of the benefits of being a guaranteed seat in a cabin that those who qualified for status cannot use for it. Genius. Maybe those folks at SQ currently sat in the secret bunker with those consultants trying to find ways to add value to the programme could indeed start by offering TPP's guaranteed access to JCL award bookings instead of these birthday upgrades that many of those who spend a lot of time on the road will not be able to use as we try to avoid travelling then. Originally posted by CarbonMan View Post Hmm ... thanks for giving me ideas on how I can make some money with TPP. Yeah, SQ knows that some of us are at the pointy end only because the company pays for it. When we are on our personal trips, we're the cheapest el-cheapos you can find! I am not sure about that. The idea that after flying north of 100 (and sometimes 150) flights a year I will then get on another aircraft to fly on holiday in Y is stretching it somewhat. I think most heavy travellers make us of the Miles & Status for their holidays. I was contemplating that, but I won't unless I'm convinced that Solitaire is nothing more than red carpets and ego. It depends what use you can make of it. The main benefit of TPP for most is the supplementary card and for me it's getting access to upgrades and awards in J and particularly F when it's not possible to get them on line and also to free up revenue seats at very short notice, which I regularly need to do. An email to my PPS co-ordinator tends to open doors that are otherwise shut, and I have to say it does make the programme worthwhile. It does for me anyway, but I have a rather fab PPS co-ordinator.

" Originally posted by LionCity View Post There is no perfect Frequent Flyer program nor perfect airline around. For example I found some of the CX's aircrafts are older and the inflight cabin crew are louder those from SQ. The food on CX while good, I don't find it fantastic. Being on Jet Airways, good personal touches but some cabin crew seems clumsy and cabins (back in October) not that fantastic (without personal video screens). I noticed our my recent flights to PVG that I am starting to see more of the younger version of the 777 regional with AVODs as compared to the past (it maybe purely more chance though). I think SQ is making a concerted effort to upgrade her fleet faster than many other airlines. Overall, cabin service is still very good and have no serious complaints. On the ground service (the side that I always complained about), I think SQ is making a strong effort to improve. I found that my recent calls to reservations are answered faster now rather than the busy tones. The staff seems also to make more effort to help passengers. While agreeing that some the PPS changes are necessary due to the program being too successful, I felt it has been overdone with corresponding reduction in benefits to save a few bucks. Very well said LionCity. There is no forum and no loyalty program people don't complain about. Everywhere there are cutbacks, wether in frequent flier programs or hotel programs. It's the way things go and we can go or stay. It is after all the airlines choice which direction they want to go just like any other business, small or large will make decisions. Some will be wise and a good move and some maybe not. We, in this case, the consumer are lucky enough to have so many choices, if we don't like SQ we can move to CX or any other airline that suits our needs. I have been a little dissappointed with the PPS changes recently but have adapted and found that SQ is still a wonderful and probably my favourite airline and Krisflyer still is a very good frequent flier program for me, even if I just stay QPPS or Elite Gold. Their redemption levels are quite good, especially with the 15% discount when booked online. So far I have been able to get the flights I wanted, much easier and better then a couple of other programs I was trying ot use my miles. Recently I have often had to deal with the calling centre in India, dialing the local Canadian number but not have had any negative experience, the opposite, it's always been pleasant and helpful. Service on board too has been consistant, though their have been a couple of flights that could have been better but still were satisfying. I am not a Solitaire nor have I ever been one, so I appologize if this is somewhat not approriate for me to comment in this thread but just wanted to express my thoughts on this.

A certain SQ Steward who a number of us on here know and was with us came back from the bar to say a couple of the girls inside were colleagues of his.

He told me that he found it easily to deal with the frequent fliers as they generally leave them alone. I guessed if you announced to them that you are PPS particularly outside work...they are thinking you imposing your status. Agreed some PPS are boorish and treat cabin crew like dirt. I find treating cabin crew with respect often rewarded with more sincere and better service. I will not hesitate to provide good feedbacks to SQ on well performing staff both on the ground and in the air. Difficult customers often lead to lower standards as good service staff are discouraged and many leave the organization. This leads to poorer staff quality and good fresh blood are discouraged to join SQ. If we sincerely want good service, respect should be two ways instead of moaning and groaning.

" I am really curious if the SITAONAIR system costs less to the airline in terms of infrastructure and use than the Panasonic one. Panasonic wifi is hands down better in every almost every aspect for the user. Even SWQ with the new dome still retains the SITAONAIR system. Itchy hand on my part decided to click price plans on my phone while trying to log in to the free wifi on a SITAONAIR system, just to check out the pricing once more, and wasn't able to go back to the free wifi login page anymore for the rest of the flight. Must be a bug, but don't do that guys! And SITAONAIR is not available over the whole of India...which means a good 3 hours without wifi on all Europe bound flights. Panasonic on the other hand, I've always been able to use it from 10,000 feet to 10,000 feet without a hitch at really commendable speeds. On a side note, flew on SMR recently, it seems that the Panasonic-fitted aircraft are shifting away from time based charging to data based plans too.

" Was wondering if any far more experienced people than I could explain the following to me? Currently booked for 2x return business saver awards SIN-LAX later this year (my wife and I). I noticed that there is first class saver award availability from SFO-SIN and I called up the call centre to ask how many extra miles it would be to change my return segment from LAX-SIN in J to SFO-SIN in F. After leaving me on hold for some time, I was told it would be 51,500 miles per passenger (103,000 total) plus $30 odd in taxes. I just can't figure out where they get the 103,000 miles figure from?

 I've complained to SQ many many times. Their problem always is at admin end of things. In general all my flights have been very good and the service of the ground staff typically from checkin to end of flight has been great service (in general). But my concerns has always been at the admin level. Different people different standards different knowledge. Always so very inconsistent and generally doing things by the book without much after thought. Typical of most MNC or big companies where the senior management firewall themselves with a line of customer officers (CSO) who are not empowered but get the brunt of the customers. My feedback to SIA has been to empower the CSO and also send them for the same service quality training as the FAs. This would be then provide a more consistent service across the board and experience for the customer.

" Originally posted by Wan1dap View Post So why keep flying with them? I can guarantee nothing will change because of your lecturing. Much better to simply fly others because of course they don't have any of these terrible problems. I'm sure you'll be much happier. Wan1dap: You have raised a very valid question...why keep flying with SQ. I think on balance, SQ does a very commendable job, given the tough business environment (apart from their 3rd rate website...). That said, I do believe that SQ fundamentally has forgotten how to to capture and retain a customer's loyalty and advocacy, the way they did in earlier years, when they were on their way to becoming the market leader. These days, my impression is that SQ takes loyalty for granted, not realizing how much this has been eroded over the years by cutbacks and reductions in benefits. Apart from QPP, TPP, LPP members, who have seen their benefits eroded, there are also whole swathes of other customer segments, e.g. KF Gold members, for whom SQ has not done much to foster their loyalty. I fly SQ a lot, mainly in Y. For many years, I flew only SQ. I have been KF Gold practically from the first year the Krisflyer programme started. Over the years, I flew more and more, to the point where, in terms of mileage, I qualified for Gold several times over in a single year. But because I fly mainly in Y, KF Gold is all I get. In early years, I used to receive a complimentary companion ticket once a year if I booked a paid ticket for myself, but that stopped too. A couple of years ago, I wrote in to SQ customer service with a request: given my spend on SQ, surely there could be more they could offer in terms of their loyalty programme. Nope, after several exchanges, the inevitable result: your feedback is noted, but nothing can be done as programme rules are rules. I am pretty sure none of my correspondence made it past the bottom one or two levels of their customer service operation. Obviously my loyalty to SQ had been only one-way up till that point. Since that time. I have changed my travel patterns, and I have become much happier. I still fly SQ a lot. I enjoy, and am quite satisfied with, the benefits that KF Gold / Star Alliance Gold provide. SQ have my complete loyalty each requalifying year, until I hit 50K miles and qualify for Gold. For me, that happens in 3-4 months more or less. Then for the rest of the year, apart from SQ, I also explore the delights of QF, AA, CX, JL, EK, BA, AF, MH and everyone else that I was previously too blinkered in my blind loyalty to try, and guess what, they have all impressed me in many different ways. I also probably spend a third of what I used to spend on SQ each year, with the rest going to the other airlines listed above. I remain an SQ fan. It is just that instead of automatically and instinctively choosing SQ, the carrier that I know most intimately and love to fly, I now make cold, calculated decisions about which airline to fly for each trip, and what value I will get from that carrier. Not unlike how I imagine SQ make decisions on how to treat their passengers in different market segments. So why fly SQ? Many good reasons, and some great ones. But at least for me, SQ will have to do a little more before they become an automatic first choice again.

" I've been thinking about this. Do I get worse treatment onboard as a PPS? My answer is always no. (Am I consistent? ) But there is something that I learned recently. While taking the new J from SIN to CDG, after sleeping since departure, I woke up, and ended up hanging out at the galley. The Kebaya Blue girls seemed so reluctant to chit chat and a bit reserved. Then I had a great conversation with the LS since he used to work with an IFS that was on one of my previous flight. After that the blue girls started to be more easy going and not too afraid of me. Well I got an expalanation from one of my SQ Angels that in general the Blue girls are a bit afraid of PPS. Afraid of making mistake. Afraid of upsetting the PPS. And yes, I recalled one of the Blue Girls told me about the experience in one of her flights. She was on duty in Y. One pax asked for newspapers which was not available. She said she would check and came back later. And the guy pulled up his PPS card and showed it to her by saying basically that he is the god of pax for being PPS. Anyway, since then, she was a bit afraid of any PPS on board. Poor Girl! I told her that I am harmless... (Note: I did see someone flashing his PPS card to the FA recently on my CGK-SIN flight.

Tie that in with a min of 1,000 miles per sector and it meant that I got 12,000 per return trip Lobster, it's 100k everywhere except for Germany, where the threshold is 130k for SEN. From that point of view, it's good for florianwagner. But if you travel on cheap whY-fares, you only get 125 miles per segment (domestic and intra-europe) plus the exec bonus once you've reached FTL. M&M is good if you travel in F and J, or on more expensive whY fares. 300% miles in F, 200% in J. Upgrade redemptions are expensive. In some cases an upgrade from whY to J is more expensive than a redemption in J. But if you travel a lot on M&M airlines, the SEN benefits are useful.

For the later, I have called Krisflyer on the phone. There is a penalty charge (I think 2,500 miles) and it may take a while (maybe 6 weeks not sure) for the miles to be recredited into your account.

" If you have spare miles to play, it could be possible as I did something similar. I booked SIN - CDG round trip initially, only to decide eventually that I want to return from LHR last year. Tickets were available for LHR-SIN, so I ticketed THAT first (remember, I already have my SIN - CDG - SIN round trip ticket), and I called SQ to break my tickets into a 1 way SIN - CDG. Effectively, they are cancelling my round trip and reissuing it into 1 way SIN - CDG, so it was done rather painlessly.

" Originally posted by jhm View Post I agree it is ""dishonest"" to agree knowing that I will not comply. However, I think it's too simplistic to say that all such dishonesty is wrong. IMO, people who say this are either lying or they are much better persons than I am. I agree, it's too simplistic. But I also think it isn't a fair characterization of my view on selling miles. A more accurate paraphrase would be, ""Selling miles, when given that it's not allowed by the T&C, is wrong most of the time."" You came up with a perfect example of dishonest behavior that, in the context of selling miles, I wouldn't be troubled with: the unemployed man who sells miles because he had to raise money. It's still dishonest -- this point is a reaction to your previous statements about there being no dishonest behavior in this situation -- but it doesn't trouble me. On the other hand, dishonest behavior motivated by the reasons I read in the previous posts, i.e., (1) SQ maximizes its profits (2) SQ has raised fares x times in a month (3) It's just a contract do not, in my personal calculus, grant exceptions to my stance. Originally posted by jhm View Post It depends on the circumstances. On that we agree. As you pointed out, what we disagree about is a specific circumstance: selling miles. Originally posted by jhm View Post There are things which are clearly wrong by my and most others' standards. There are other things which I would not do myself but I can't criticise those who do (selling of miles is one of them as far as I'm concerned). Finally, there are those things where I am a dishonest person but I think it's best to forgive and forget, e.g. buying a cheaper return when I know I will only use the oneway; or taking a bottle of water from a lounge despite signs saying everything should be consumed inside. No disagreement from me there. I take water from a lounge for my consumption, but to push your example further, I would have a problem with my behavior if I take water from the lounge and then sell it to a passenger who didn't have access to the lounge. Funny things, these personal ethical boundaries. Nice examples, by the way. They helped me clarify where my boundaries were.

" From $20M to $100M to upgrade more lounges Originally posted by ST Singapore Airlines (SIA) will spend $100million - five times more than the $20 million it originally wanted to spend - to revamp its airport lounges around the world in a bid to maintain its edge in an increasingly competitive field. The announcement on Tuesday came after SIA unveiled its new-look lounge in Sydney, the first of 15 lounges to be refreshed over the next five years. Plans are now underway to roll out the new ""home away from home"" lounge concept in London, Hong Kong and Singapore (Terminal 3) next year, said SIA in a statement. The new look, developed by local firm Ong & Ong, is aimed at making premium passengers feel at home with fittings that replicate the living and dining room, as well as, the kitchen. The lounge boasts more personal work spaces inside the workstation pod seats and new SIA-only high-back armchairs. Passengers will also be able to get a taste of home with the lounges serving local dishes like laksa and mee siam, with First Class passengers enjoying butler services The lounge will also features art pieces that showcase Singapore and the country of departure. Mr Tan Pee Teck, SIA's senior vice president for product and services, said: ""Each space is thoughtfully designed to create the ambiance of home that is familiar and comforting, adding to the warm, authentic and personalised service that Singapore Airlines is well known for."" http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking...ves-times-over ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.9087965488433838, 0.09120340645313263]",amenity_catering_lounges

I have been booking SIN-AMS-SIN Saver tickets for 15 years using miles, so I have a good sense of availability/dates. I am certain that there has been a change in policy of some sort - either on this specific route or for SIA in general. May be it is tied to the roll out of A350. I asked Singapore Airlines direct, but they neither confirmed or denied despite repeated requests. They just responded that there are a limited number of seats available, cannot guarantee, etc, etc. But the response sounded evasive because it did not answer my clear question. Did the quota of Saver spaces change recently? Is it specifically tied to SIN-AMS-SIN? Did anyone else notice a change? Where can I get a real answer for such a question?

" Soon to be in SIN, with stingy employer: which FFP? Hallo everyone, this is my first post on here after having found you via a hint on FlyerTalk. If possible, I would appreciate your advice on the situation I will be finding myself in soon. I am moving out to SIN from LON in Feb/Mar 2009 with work and will be doing a lot of travelling in SE Asia. Most of this (90%) will be done in whY, with the very occasional trip in J and none in F. Main destinations will be Jakarta, Manila, Hong Kong, Taipei, Shanghai, Beijing, Colombo, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok (if they will have opened their airport again by then), amounting to 3-4 rtn trips per month. In addition, there will be around 4 roundtrips to Europe (Switzerland and Germany) per, annoyingly also in Y. I noticed from a few random fare comparisons on Kayak that SQ almost always seems to come out twice as expensive as MH, for instance. As a consequence, my employer will prefer to put me on Malaysia Airlines, so I won't be able to accumulate miles on * Alliance too often. Similarly, CX are also quite pricey in comparison. I have no status in any FFP apart from soon Silver on BA EC. I would like to use the FFP benefits mostly to access lounges in airports and to use accumulated miles to upgrade to J on long flights within Asia (e.g. China) and Europe. Unfortunately, from what I have read, Malaysia's Enrich program seems not to be a good FFP, although they are a good airline. Since I will be based in SIN, do you think it would be a good idea nonetheless to aim for PPS on KF, or Elite Gold, in particular if I get a KF AmEx card and take advantage of other ""local benefits""? Or is there a trick to funnel my miles on MH into M&M? I saw that Enrich does credit miles flown on LX to their members accounts, but vice versa? I hope you can see my predicament and would appreciate your advice a lot!

" Miles &amp; Cash finally official When were those Krisflyer feedback sessions when they told people about this ?. Oh yeah, 2010 !!!!. I suppose they've be thinking about what rates they can get away with... Dear Mr MAN Flyer, We are pleased to inform you that from 18 July 2013, you will be able to use your KrisFlyer miles to pay for all, or a part of your Singapore Airlines or SilkAir airfare (including taxes and surcharges) when you book on singaporeair.com With this new payment option, you may combine your miles with cash (payable with credit/debit card) to pay for an airfare on your desired flight, instead of waiting for that award ticket and/or flight upgrade to become available. Plus, with only a minimum of about 5,000 KrisFlyer miles to start, this feature will also allow you to use smaller amounts of miles in your account that may be expiring. To start, all you need to do is log in at singaporeair.com and check the 'Pay with KrisFlyer miles' box before searching for your flight(s). You may also like to know that in subsequent enhancements, you can use your KrisFlyer miles to cover the cost of taxes and surcharges associated with your redemption award tickets. We hope you will benefit from this new initiative, the latest in a series of revamps made to the KrisFlyer programme. You can look forward to hearing from us in the coming months as we work on further improvements to our loyalty programme. Thank you and we look forward to welcoming you onboard soon.

" Originally posted by HUGE AL View Post Is there a reason you chose QF over all other OW FFPs? I signed up to the QF FF programme many years ago, even before Krisflyer was launched. I've not done a detailed comparison of the merits of other OW FF programmes like CX / BA, but I chose the QF programme simply because among the Oneworld carriers, I flew them the most, and over the longest distances. Apart from SQ, they are my airline of choice to ANZ, and to London (If I decide to do a one-stop). Even today, if I choose a one-stop to London, I will try to fly the DXB-LHR sector on QF metal. They have treated me quite well as a frequent flyer (QF Gold / OW Sapphire this year), with the occasional op-up from PEY to J. And even though I fly only Y, I can use their superb lounges in Australia, HKG and elsewhere. The OW lounges that CX, JL and BA have in their respective home bases are very good as well. I've also been upgraded several times on CX and BA. Award and upgrade availability has been ok as well. As an unintended benefit, through the EK tie-up, I get to use the EK lounges too (Although I have never been upgraded on EK). SIN is my home base, and if I had to go with one program, SQ and Krisflyer/Star would be the one. But being a frequent flyer on Qantas/Oneworld has brought me many benefits as well, and I am happy to have had the opportunity to sample what Oneworld has to offer.

The Swiss Booking Class is V. Which according to KF, I qualify for miles earned on the LX flight but... V is not a booking class that is qualified for mileage earn on SQ. Does that therefore mean I will not earn any miles on the SQ operated codeshare flight with LX, because I remember that it states on the SQ site that codeshare flights will be based on the Operating Airline rules... If that is the case, will I only receive the miles for my LX flight and not the SQ flight? and Should I thus credit the miles to M&M instead, *which doesn't recognise V as a booking class that earns miles* Very confusing.

We fully understand the frustration Ms Low and Mr Sim went through, and sincerely apologise to them for the inconvenience.

We manage this very carefully, and are generally able to accommodate every passenger who has a confirmed booking in his respective cabin class of travel. In the event that a flight is overbooked, we try our best to secure a seat for the customer depending on seat availability in the various cabin classes, or arrange for an alternative flight.

" Unfortunately, if you aren't KrisFlyer Gold (or *A Gold), you have no free lounge access when flying in Y. However, the KrisFlyer Gold Lounges don't have showers, so I don't think the lounge you'd have been able to access for free with status would have been what you were looking for anyway. However, as SQ747 suggests, you can use the vouchers claimed via the transit voucher programme to access the Ambassador Transit Lounges, which do have showers. They're not free, though most people think of them as being ""free"" since they paid no money out of their own pockets for them by using the aforementioned vouchers. I believe you should be able to claim the vouchers by presenting your ticket/boarding pass at the iShop Changi counters in the transit area. Any information counter will be happy to direct you there (or wherever else they are issuing vouchers at the moment). One issue you might have is that I think they're discontinuing the transit voucher programme sometime in April or May, so you may not be able to collect any, and hence will have to pay to use the transit lounge. Also, one other thing: if you want to go land-side there's an arrival lounge (with showers, I believe) in T3 you can use (for a fee).

" I don't get it. When one flies an indirect route from one point to another with a transit/stopover at another airport, Krisflyer awards you miles calculated based on a non-stop route.

A 773 might be a downgrade from a 380, but it still beats sitting 10 hours in the PEK lounge. Moreover, this flight gets substituted with a 77W frequently. Who knows, it may become permanent in another 6 months. But if that fails.... 1) not sure if TSE agents will be that helpful when things are not exactly so clear cut as per procedure...(2 separate tickets interlining). 2) I have done this. It's a redemption flight on same ticket. MXP-FRA-PVG-SIN-CGK. In Shanghai, i changed from 10hour transit to 1.5hr connection at the check-in counter. For some reason, we were landside.

" Originally posted by KeithMEL View Post Are you referring to the SEN 'buy-back' program? Otherwise I'm not sure how the 3 year thing works. No. I was a bit inebriated when this was explained to me so I didn't follow it closely. Luckily, alex0683de was kind enough to explain it again just now for me: Originally posted by alex0683de Hi jhm, certainly, the way it works is as follows (feel free to post this on SQTalk as well, I'm not a member there): If you qualify for Senator by flying 100K status miles in 2007, you get your status for the rest of the year in which you qualify (2007), plus two full years (2008, 2009), plus the first two months of the third calendar year after you qualify (Jan/Feb 2010). If you qualify for SEN in either 2008 or 2009, your status is entended by two years (2010, 2011), putting your new expiration date at Feb 2012. However, if you requalify your Senator status after theoretically having lost it (by flying 100K in Jan/Feb 2010), it will be treated as a new qualification, rather than a requalification, meaning you will get all of 2010, plus two full years (2011, 2012), putting your new expiration date at Feb 2013. The trick is timing your flights well enough to earn that 100K status miles in two months and having everything credit on time to maintain uninterrupted SEN status. This can be done with a well-planned 39K-RTW in C (making use of the airlines on which you earn the 25% Executive Bonus: LH, LX, OS, LO, UA, US, AC, JP, and OU), or by planning the RTW to take advantage of the 2000 (+500 Exec. Bonus) flatrate mile credit for intra-European sectors in C, or by flying a 34K-RTW in F. There are some other ways as well, like using LX's special fares in C within Europe (Z-Class FRA-GVA-ZRH-VIE-ZRH-GVA-FRA in one day for 600 all-in, for almost 14K miles - known on the LH board as the HON Run). It requires some advance planning and two months of heavy travel to kick off the year, but it is more than possible to maintain uninterrupted SEN status by requalifying once every three years. Hope this helps. Cheers, Alex ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.6801161170005798, 0.31988388299942017]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Originally posted by StarG View Post An excellent airline called Cathay Pacific Airways also flies out of Singapore, usually with keener fares than SQ. You get more miles by going via HKG , good award redemption value for F & J, and a loyalty program that really shows appreciations of the loyal customers. Hmm. Someone called? I actually heard from a sales rep at SQ in LAX last year who told me that SQ management was aware of the fact that people were buying 'cheap' tickets and doing segment counts in order to qualify (geee, I wonder who those people are).. and that SQ wants to stamp out such behaviour. He did mention then that there were rumours that SQ would count how much you really spend with them instead of how much you fly! RTW tickets? I guess SQ will take total value of your ticket to divide it against the total mileage so as to figure out the $ value per mile, then multiply it by your flight sector/miles. Originally posted by SQflyergirl View Post .... 1. LPPS to be abolished. Dunno what happens to existing LPPS members though. ** This might be similar to CX's Diamond Life programme. It changed its name to Invitation, and requalifying is based on a case-by -case situation - much like BA's Premier. The more travel revenue you control (ie company execs etc), the better you are to remain an Invitation member. 2 .The PPS miles/sectors system of qual to be abolished. PPS qual by revenue - set at circa $25 000 SGD ** I think I remember one other airline in asia doing this.. was it CI or BR, based on revenue. It wasn't the total miles flown, but how much money you spent. 3. TPPS benefits to remain the same. BUT... 4.

Funds must be held for at least 6 months with DBS/POSB bank. http://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/prom...es-2014-Brand- Note that ""new funds"" means the funds must not exist in the person's existing DBS/POSB account as of joining date. Which means that an existing DBS/POSB bank account holder who's not currently a Treasures customer can wire S$300k out of his funds to another bank, sign up for Treasures, wire that funds back in, and its considered ""new funds"". And as an alternative, the customer can request for S$888 cash instead of 40k bonus. 2) Between 1 Jun 2014 to 31 May 2015, DBS Treasures customers who enrol in a Travel Program will earn 20% bonus Krisflyer miles (bonus mileage is based on distance travel). Interesting thing is that only ""G"" fare does not earn bonus, which means that some cheap economy tickets that does not qualify for Krisflyer miles can actually earn mileage on this program. http://www.singaporeair.com/jsp/cms/...privileges.jsp Anyone else who's signed up ???

" Aegean? OK, I'm one of those who uses SQ regularly for business because of company policies. I was QPP for several years, but given changes in my company's travel policies, job scope and family life, I failed to requalify this year and am now a lowly Silver. The one that I need is lounge access - so I need to get *G status quickly. I'm less particular about mileage redemption opportunities, cause these days, availability is not particularly good for the destinations/times I want to fly, that I almost always end up purchasing tickets on alternative carriers (including budget). I think I'd be able to clock around 30,000 miles a year on a mix of Business and Economy on SQ mostly on regional routes. I'm now thinking of getting a quick *G status via the Aegean program. My company policy allows me to fly Business on UA to HK (or economy on SQ). I calculate that all I need is 3 business class roundtrips (my bookings are C class which gives a 100% bonus according to the website) to HK on UA to achieve *G on Aegean, which I should easily be able to do. I would probably continue accumulating the rest of the miles on the pathetic KF program - at least I get 25% bonus and from time to time, redeem DPS tickets for the family for a steal. Questions: 1.

My question is that what is the best time to upgrade? I am also very keen on trying the new product, that Raffles new seats are sweet! To Paris it's 45k. not 50 from Y to J. Originally posted by quik! View Post Basically my travel pattern is KUL->LHR via SIN. Now 773ER doesn't operate this route of course, so I'm thinking of KUL->SIN->CDG and then hop onto either BD or even BA for the CDG to LHR leg. Does anyone have any idea will this cost almost the same as a KUL->LHR ticket? Probably about the same. The extra money you have to pay for the CDG-LHR leg will offset the longhaul UB tax (hefty) imposed by the UK governments if you bought a KUL-LHR-KUL ticket. Another good bit of news is that ex-KUL, DO NOT redeem the upgrade online. You won't be eligible for the KUL-SIN leg upgrade for free. If you do it via KMS - the KUL-SIN leg is booked in O, and the upgrade is ""through"" from KUL-CDG.

Actually a month ago, I thought of doing this piece of analysis for the SKL F lounge usage: (1) find out the max design capacity of SKL. (2) Analyse the number of F pax using SKL on basis of departing all SQ flights every hour. Of course, one have to make certain assumptions like all F pax uses SKL, x% of PPS J users, etc. Would be nice to see the SKL F pax trend every hour per day.

" Originally posted by Jamiegutz View Post Hi, Doc has put me on a strict diet to get my BP down, and i have an F booking from SIN-LHR in Jan. Now, normally i would BTC and have 8oz Rib Eye Steak washed down with as much Krug/DP as i can get my hands on (wonder why i need to go on a diet???) So, anyone had any experience of the Low fat meals in F? What are they like? Thanks J According to the website: Low Fat/Cholesterol Meal: No animal fats but poly-unsaturated fatty acids allowed; limited fats/sauces/gravy fried items; no butter/cream/whole milk cheese; only lean meat allowed I have never ordered one. So I don't know what you will get on board. But, from my personal experience, when I had to watch my health, I should eat in moderation, as well as know what I should not eat. I was able to order from the main menu by doing mis-match things up. From the definition of the low fat - low cholesterol, pick lean meat. And yeah no heavy salad dressing, olive oil should be fine I think. I will skip butter. And pick the vegetables from the menu which looks better for my health. Of course, if your doctor really wants you to have a very very strict low fat diet, that will be a different story!

Technically they should do the same on renewal (as, from memory, I think CX does on their MPC?) BUT in their terms it says only 'earn at least 50,000miles' during the membership year. It's not necessarily fair either. If you're Gold from say September, and then you hit 50K by say December, and your Gold gets ""renewed"" for another 12 months from that date, you basically got short-changed by 8-9 months, no?

" ANZ CSOs have not been consistent with answers, so I'll wait till they update their website. I'm not into collecting miles with credit cards as my leisure travel patterns don't optimize miles usage, but I use this card for all my spend except fuel, as it has a very generous cash rebate rate. The 1.4 miles per $1 converts to slightly over 2.5% cash rebate, double that for travel spend (which will go away, but still attractive), and a whopping 7.5% for grocery and EZ-link top-ups! I don't see how ANZ makes money on this card if I kept choosing cash rebates, as interchange fees are only around 2%. I had expected them to change the cash redemption ratios down, not the miles earning rate. Also the current 14k Travel$ monthly cap only applies to the double miles promotion....there doesn't seem to be any cap on regular spend. I just earned more than 15k Travel$ this month (which I promptly converted to cash). ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5386058688163757, 0.46139413118362427]",amenity_catering_lounges

" jjpb3 makes some good points in the open complaint letter thread which I thought I'd discuss here to keep that thread OT: Originally posted by jjpb3 Finally, because we do fly SQ partly because it happens to serve the destinations we go to, possibly the most frequent reaction might just be to shift to a less miserly FFP. Peanuts, yes, but it means KrisFlyer doesn't get payments from my *A flights whereas the partner FFP would, including my SQ flights. More important, SQ loses a good source of customer data, as well as a touchpoint with its customers. What will peoples' reactions to this change be ? 1 Switch to another FFP. KF doesn't get payments but also doesn't end up with corresponding liabilities. For those of us (like myself) who are mainly interested in redeeming on SQ, switching to another FFP doesn't work if - as shortfinals suggests - it will not be possible at all to redeem for 77W/380 flights with miles from other FFPs. 2 Cut up and return my PPS card and never take another SQ flight if I can help it. Painful though the announced changes may be, I don't think I'm at this stage and this is precisely what SQ are counting on. 3 Reduce the number of SQ flights taken. Like jjpb3 says, SQ serve a destination I go to frequently (SIN) but given that I also like HK very much, I suppose I could do an indirect routing in future with TAir. It would probably mean not requalifying for PPS and getting *G on some other FFP (e.g. BD); or, even ditching *A status altogether, given the withdrawal of UA LHR-JFK and that out of my 70+ sectors and 100,000+ BIS miles this year, the only *A flights have been SQ, UA to JFK and other *A airlines for my SQ PPS RTW run. 4 Moan (either here on SQT or to SQ) but ultimately take the pain with no change in my flying/FFP habits.

Of course that only makes it difficult to know if the flight you want to upgrade is available or not as it seems they are using their normal redemption allotment for this (as per the lady at KF). I found out the outbound flight I wanted is full for updgrade redemtption (even before it began), so I have changed my flight where she told me seats were still available.

I have noticed inconsistencies, which I guess will be resolved after the 8th when the change is applied properly and officially.

If you try with certain connection to other routes and markets I noticed the Saver awards were not always possible, I also noticed more F than J saver availability based upon what I found.

I havent flown out of MUC for quite a while but I did fly into it just a couple of weeks ago and SQ328 definitely didnt pull into the new satellite terminal. Instead it was a gate at the original T2 building with the H gates, so bear that in mind for your lounge selection. Of course its possible that other days SQ do use the satellite at T2. Im basing this off one day. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.7344540953636169, 0.26554590463638306]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Still Confused about KF Elite Gold Qualification I know this has been discussed over and over again. Sorry for making all you guys yawn. I'm putting up my past and future accrual here - hopefully the table format helps everyone get a timeline picture of my situation. I've been a KF member for many years but have not been accumulating mileage seriously until last year. My KF membership runs from Sep - Aug. I was promoted to KF ES in Dec 2009 and my KF ES membership runs from Dec - Nov. The table is pretty self-explanatory. Counter 1 shows my cumulative mileage for current KF membership year, while Counter 2 shows my cumulative mileage since obtaining KF ES. This leads to the most famous question everyone has been asking - when will I get KF EG? In Aug 2010 when I've achieved 56946 miles for the current KF membership year? Or in Oct 2010 when I've achieved 52601 miles (reset) after starting as KF ES? While most members on this forum have been able to achieve KF EG after achieving 50k during the ordinary membership year, SQ's website seems to suggest that it requires 50k more after qualifying for KF ES. I quote SQ website saying ""KrisFlyer Elite Gold status will be yours when you achieve 50,000 Elite miles in any class of service on Singapore Airlines, SilkAir or any Star Alliance airline during your Elite Silver membership year"" Comments and recent experiences will be appreciated.

" Originally posted by alian View Post Agreed on your point but why is it so ? From my knowledge and understanding home based usually cost more than foreign when it comes to full fledge carriers. SQ seems cheaper than QF when booking in AUS for example it seems to be the case in many scenarios. Also ME3 carriers are super subsides by their governments. Besides EK think the others are all losing $$$ so the comparison is hard to make clearly and really not a level playing field. That's why I pointed out on loyalty earlier but it has to go both ways. When someone books a ticket whether it is home station or whether carrier X or Y is government subsidized is not the main factor. Value is - and this can take many forms depending on the travelers individual preferences. I see a value differential in SQ's onboard service and the fact that the E3 (or others for that matter) involve a stopover. But the value I get out of loyalty is really low when compared to others. All of these I guess determine that extra amount that different travelers would be able to fork to go a specific carrier and/or travel class. I just find it quite unsustainable to present PEY at the price point it is presented right now when there J options available even though they might involve other inconveniences. And looking at the acceptance PEY is having, they might need to look into it before declaring it failure. Just my 2 cents!

" I am afraid to say that the SKL just doesn't cut it any longer in the bigger scheme of things. Take away the Dom, and I suppose some of the variances of food, and I am afraid it's just another every day average lounge. It may have been a bit of a market leader initially but I am afraid it has been caught up and overtaken by a number of lounges. What has surprised me is, listening to the interviews with the launch of the new inflight products they kept saying how other airlines had launched new products and closed the gap, so they were taking the lead again. If that is so, what are they going to do about the fact that a number of airlines flagship lounges are far better than Changi's SKL, and in some cases blow it away ?. Off the top of my head the lounges that are far better than it are: LH FCL - Now widely believed to be the best in the world CX Wing at HKG - supposedly their biggest rival! VS LHR Clubhouse - other Clubhouses may also be better I don't know, but they own 49% on this lot for heavens sake.... MH KUL lounge - some may disagree with this but take away the Dom and being in here is a far more enjoyable experience. Another local rival to boot. QR have just opened a dedicated lounge for J & F pax and other will undoubtedly follow. I am sure there are others. The answer is not to try and reduce the number of your top tier FF's but to make sure you have sufficient facilities for them. If their pax numbers are increasing, and bearing in mind SQ's reliance on those up front, then the lounges need updating.

On top of that T3 is huge - the gates and check in area are connected by a train. PEK has a 1hr cutoff for check-in, but even that may be cutting it real close. [I wrote this when I read you have a 4hr transit, but now you have 11hrs. 11hrs is a bit tricky - I really wouldn't want to stick around in the airport for so long (see comments about the lounge below), but given traffic unpredectability, not even sure if it is worth getting out. Neither here nor there.....not sure how to advise you.] Originally posted by SQ228 View Post Anyone with recent experience of the SQ T3 lounge in PEK? It's a contract lounge.

" Originally posted by SQTalker View Post One day when my travel agent telling me some interesting figures about the mileage runners, where they used to hook on to the PPS program. She told me that roughly about 50% of the HKG & 30% SFO based PPS will drop out a year after since they are now issuing more CX J & F ticket instead. A few switching to NH & JL too. She was asking me if a traveler anyway is traveling in J/F, they got their bags tag in priority, lounge access, & being a PPS, got the same privileges, only in the case of if you are on the waiting list, it may help you to clear ahead with someone. So what's the point of being an elite program like PPS...? With the year 2008 almost towards the end, I didn't receive any events invitation at all, none in HKG (where my brother is a PPS), none in SFO...& no A380 brochure mail out too...unlike a couple years ago when they introducing the 77W, at least we had a cocktail event, & on-going nice 77W brochure..... Not surprising. When I was in HKG, a number of investment bankers I know of based there were into flying SQ a fair bit of the time to maintain PPS. With the PPS Value based is not any enhancement compared to CX Gold.

However, I think SQ's upgrade policy is actually no different than that of a lot of other airlines (no upgrade unless necessary) - except perhaps SQ's policy on F on the A380 (I haven't kept up with whether this has changed or not ?) - and SQ do upgrade more than just a few people out of necessity. Quite a number can be found on here! http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=91 Indeed, and I am not saying there aren't op-ups on SQ as I've had two myself. However, they are known to be notoriously stingy with them compared to other airlines, especially the US carriers, who were mentioned for comparison by the OP. The US airlines policy has always baffled me to be honest, handing it out for free. They do still have that anal A380 policy in place as well, which makes them look plain silly to be honest, especially as they have now quiety dropped that daft tag line. The best way to get an op-up on SQ is to be UMD it seems. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.6022897958755493, 0.3977101445198059]",krisflyer

The changes are fair and balanced and in the bigger picture the total cost for my award travel will be more or less the same.

" Does Krisflyer permit outbound both eastwards (e.g., with Asiana to JFK) and westwards (e.g., with SQ or LH)? It’s pretty much the same distance from Singapore but I might have a preference regarding flight times/ airlines. Also, are there significant differences in taxes that I should consider? Also, what is the chance that the FRA-JFK segment on SQ clears in J? Currently only waitlist even 1 year ahead (SIN-FRA no problem on SQ). If it doesn’t clear, is LH usually available on FRA-JFK? United.com doesn’t show any availability. Does LX ever clear in J (as I would prefer LX over LHR and SIN-ZRH seems no problem on SQ)? Assuming outbound westwards is ok, would this be a valid redemption routing?

" Originally posted by yflyer View Post I received the email today as well. For Krisflyer Gold members who mainly fly economy class, it is a welcome step forward. It means that after qualifying for Elite Gold at 50K, there are still additional benefits for very frequent flyers, when you go to 60K, 75K and 100K miles. This is better than the current state of affairs, where frequent flyers who don't fly Business or First/Suites essentially hit a ceiling at 50K miles and Elite Gold, and don't get any additional benefits, even if they fly 150K or 200K Y miles a year with SQ. I think it is a step in the right direction, although I personally think they need to go even further than that, for example, J upgrades rather than PEY, or as someone mentioned, an even higher FF tier than Elite Gold that very frequent economy flyers can aspire to. But I doubt SQ will go as far as a new FF tier, as they already have PPS, targeting Business and First/Suites pax, which seems to work well for the airline. Yeah, but given most of us Y flyers fly on Flexi Saver though, the qualifying threshhold is now 66.6k in ""real terms"". They've wiped out an entire band of KFEG members with that change, so I'm not surprised they're willing to be more generous to the remaining Y flyers who can actually still qualify. I've got 6 months left and then I'm KFES or lower. And can someone remind me of the actual benefits of KFES again... Oh wait, you get a silver card instead of blue!

" Hi, Been lurking on here for a while but this is my first post! Have been KF *G member for the last three years and have allways just managed to make the 50,000 miles requalification criteria. After doing some research i have decided that i may be better off joining another FFP when requalify for *G in september this year. I am seriously considering TG ROP as *G lasts 2 years and also get the upgrade certs. As i am technically self employed i pay for all my business travel and use TG mostly on flights back to Europe in J Class. I mainly use SQ for regional travel. Also considering BMI as well, but something does not seem right about joining an FFP for an airline that i have never even flown (i live in singapore, hence the reason i joined KF). WOuld be interested to hear from other members who have made the change . My plan is to requalify for *G in September and then join another FFP so i can earn points on the new one, but still have the benefit of lounge access, *G check in etc on my existing KF *G. Also, if i do this does anyone know if i can upgrade from Y to J on KF miles but still earn miles on the Y sector on another FFP??

" TPR Experience let me add my 2 cents to the reviews from those of us who ´made it´´ into TPR - first of all i wasn´t sure i´d get in since i was travelling on a contest prize ticket but apparently it shows as Paid (at least there was a P on my boarding pass) plus i was leaving out of T2 to Dubai - but when i told the nice lounge dragons that i wanted to check out the lounge at T3 they told me i was eligible for tpr and sure enough when i got there i was given no flak - in fact, i was given a tour of the bus and first lounges it really is NO BIG DEAL - slightly more personalized and obsequious service - to my shock, the belgian waffle is FROZEN at first i was the only person in there (at about 8am) then one guy came in and had a quick brekkie of scrambled eggs and left it´s of course very nice to get pass the secret door but not worth sweating over IMHO ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.858421266078949, 0.14157873392105103]",amenity_catering_lounges

I know some airlines will have a manifest that showed the booking class, even on its Boarding Pass. But on SQ, if you look at the BP, there is no differentiation at all. First is red.

 I just qualified for PPS last week. Have not experienced the 'god like treatment' in the air yet (will do so tomorrow though on SIN-CGK) but one big difference i have noticed is the Call centre - after you enter your KF number you are automatically sent straight through to an agent based in singapore ..... so no need to choose options etc etc.. Have not been put thru to ICC yet. Hold times are very short in comparison. Got my PPS pack in the post very fast after qualifying with some nice leather luggage tags (look much nicer than the EG ones with the plastic thing that falls off after a few trips). The card looks a bit different to ones i have seen. In the air ... will wait and see.

" i believe it is a personal choice... however, i think any person will not say that it is MUCH better than *G, especially in light of the recent changes. if you already fly C and F predominantly, than there is really no difference at all, unless you are a heavy packer, in which case you get to check in 2 extra bags per family member (even if the rest of your family members are not PPS). in addition, you will get in flight vouchers somewhere in the neighborhood of 200SGD..however, considering you have to spend an additional 6000SGD just to qualify for PPS, you could take that 6000, park it in a short-term, interest yielding CD, and make more than 200, while trying out some other nice flight products, and saving some money along the way (never a bad thing in this economic climate). furthermore, therehave been instances (more than one actually) when trying to access the lounges of united and us airways, where my PPS card actually caused more trouble than just carrying a regular old *G card. the dragons would read ""PPS Club"" and think that it was the same thing as Red Carpet Club, and inform me that SQ's club does not have reciprocity. This is despite the fact that my BP also had the number and STAR GOLD on it, in addition to the fact that the PPS card states it is STAR GOLD. my personal take, go for PPS if you love flying SQ, and you will qualify on your travels alone... but don't spend unneccesary money for it, when other options are cheaper, or change itineraries to go far out of your way to fly SQ metal. the benefits of PPS justaren't worth it anymore. all that being said, it has been reported on here that several of the LHR-SIN 747 routes are being grounded because of low yields and the high fuel they burn, so there is the chance you could be upgraded to the A380 if that happens. however, it is certainly not my place to speculate on the odds of that happening. either way, enjoy your travels.

Hmm, the slipper lobster is unfortunately not a true lobster, as in the sort you'd find in lobster sashimi. It is a crustacean though, so it has that same meat texture as other crustaceans, but much smaller than a true lobster. Some may find it a little underwhelming. And it's not very expensive.

Your feedback is valuable to us, Mr Tan, and we are concerned to learn that our passengers are still experiencing problems with our website and mobile application. We do seek to provide our customers with a smooth navigational experience and have requested our IT Department to look into the various issues and examples which you have highlighted. Our IT colleagues will continue to work closely with our vendor to investigate the cause of these issues and rectify them where needed. Mr Tan, we have noted your further feedback regarding boarding priority for our KrisFlyer Elite Gold members. We seek your understanding that boarding priority is still given to our Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold passengers, albeit in the same lane as Economy Class passengers. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that you feel the boarding priority has been removed, and that the change in the boarding sequence was not properly disseminated to our passengers. Your sentiments have been conveyed to our Ground Services Department as we continue to review our boarding process, as well as how we can communicate better with our passengers on future initiatives. Once again, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us. We look forward to welcoming you on board our flights again soon. Yours sincerely Senior Manager, Customer Affairs Singapore Airlines Limited ------ My Response: Dear XX, Thank you for your response below. Your comment: ""...we are concerned to learn that our passengers are still experiencing problems with our website and mobile application."" Seems to suggest that SIA's Management is shocked to learn that its Customers are still experiencing inconveniences with your website. For the record, may I highlight that the system incapabilities were basic. On a good day, a simple step had to be repeated twice, before the system could register the queries, such as checking for available flights; booking of tickets; flight redemptions etc. On other occasions, paid flight bookings that had e-tickets already issued could not be located, and the ""618"" ticket number re-entered. Simple tasks such as seat selections, meal selections couldn't be fulfilled. The list continues... Surprisingly, SilkAir seems to have a more stable platform than its Parent Company. Senior Management must urgently address these matters. Bluntly put across, SIA has no luxury of time. Bugs need to be fixed. IT needs to be consulted urgently. In large MNCs, heads would have rolled. SIA is definitely NOT a small organization, and I hope the same applies. Most of us would have heard that Tim Cook (CEO, Apple Inc) had made a Senior individual redundant when the Apple maps application failed to deliver, resulting in an international uproar. Whilst the questions below are definitely of an internal matter, I would encourage Management to consider the following: a) Who proposed and tabled the board paper for the system upgrade? Similar to Apple Inc, has anything been done at SIA to hold those accountable for this ""costly"" damage? Other than financial loss, such as ""forgone online-bookings"", there would also be a non-quantifiable reputation loss? b) Did your in-house IT team perform an extensive User Acceptance Test (UAT) in 2011? This is a ""Basic 101"" requirement, and hopefully was one of the ""many"" test steps prior to the vendor being paid for services ""delivered""? c) Did the SIA IT Internal Audit team raise deficiencies and recommend action plans for remedial action? d) The vendor clearly failed to meet SIA's standards and requirements. It likely failed to deliver, per its ""Scope of Work"". Has the vendor been penalized? Have actions been taken? e) Post-2011, there have been numerous ""upgrades"" to your website, of which SIA had been criticized at least once, for a 48 hour downtime. Has this overhaul shown any significant improvements? My response on this is ""No"". As a patron of SIA, I hope that the above will be addressed with extreme urgency. SIA's report card on this matter will be evaluated by the public, and to a significant extent, by the individuals who travel extensively for business reasons. Thank you. You have not and will not achieve anything with this pompous nonsense. Stop grandstanding.

" Originally posted by lingua101 View Post Since I never fly F class ever, my dream is to fly F class before it gets phase out. So I am thinking to redeem F class ticket, so need advise from you guys. - Should I do reward redemption or buy C class and do upgrade? - Which destination require less mileage (i.e. distance/mileage is the lowest). Of course don't think it is worth to fly to CGK or HKG on F, as it is too short. - is SQ burn rate is better or TG? also which one will be worthwhile? I got mileage on both and can transfer my PremierMiles or HSBC to both of them. Thanks for any suggestion Firstly, the crucial question is how many miles do you have for burning???? 1. To answer Q1. You should do a comparison chart and see which one has less nett mileage requirement. You need to have a specific destination first and then do the detailed calculation including miles spent, miles earned if on upgrade, and all the associated taxes. Different routes will have different scenarios so you have to do this homework first. 2. Best ratio is at saver levels, at the highest cabin class (F savers), and to the furthest destination which is Sao Paulo. And flying out of Sao Paulo means almost zero surcharges. Only USD45 from there to Singapore but only from there, not if you buy a return flight from Singapore. You can tag SQ67 to any Southeast destinations for free. For example Sao Paulo-Singapore-Manila. But I like Jakarta because 3 of the planes going there has retrofitted F. And my roots are there. 3. I don't know how to compare with TG. Can't help you with this one.

I had a phone call from someone at Singapore Airlines today who apologised quite extensively at the failings of multiple call centre staff and three weeks after the original event, my flights have been amended as they should have been; with a simple change (equivalent to a date change), the unauthorised cancelled ticket re-issued and the expired points re-used. In the end, all is well. Although, no one should have to go through this. In the end, it came down to staff training and competence, which in my opinion, seems to be getting a lot worse at the general call centre level. Thanks to all of you for your discussion!

" Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post I think that's a good approach: try various types of veggie meals and see for yourself. Personally, my default is VLML, with Indian and sometimes Oriental (i.e. Chinese) for variety. I avoid VGML - vegan - as that tends to be boring. If you have enough sectors, you should try the various meals at different sectors, as that will add more variety and give you an idea of which caterers do a better job at which meal type. For a while (this is back in the 80's and early 90's), the VLML meals out of Australia were excellent and consistently better than other stations. Thank you. I quite like the VLML, it's just that it can be a repeptitive - I think there are two meals on the first leg, and a meal on the second leg, and they are usually pasta based, with some kind of omelette for breakfast. I've done this a few times now (this is my third trip from LHR to BNE with SQ and it won't be the last), so probably a good time for a change.

" From singaporeair.com: Los Angeles Star Chef Suzanne Goin Joins Singapore Airlines' International Culinary Panel 30 June 2011 - One of America’s top-rated chefs, Suzanne Goin, has been named as the newest member of the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. The co-proprietor of celebrated Los Angeles restaurants Lucques, A.O.C. and Tavern, Suzanne joins a host of global food talents on the panel, including renowned French chef Georges Blanc and Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar & Grill in New York. Her menus will debut on SIA flights between Singapore and US cities from 1 August 2011. ""We are delighted to welcome Suzanne Goin as the newest member to our International Culinary Panel. We believe her talent and contribution will complement the existing expertise on the panel, and anticipate her inventive culinary creations, which I am certain will impress our customers,"" said Mr Tan Pee Teck, SIA’s Senior Vice President Product and Services. A deeply respected figure in the Los Angeles dining scene, Suzanne brings an inventive and distinctly Californian style to SIA’s inflight dining experience, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients from local markets and purveyors, and preparations rooted in classic culinary traditions. Suzanne was named one of Food and Wine magazine’s “Best New Chefs” in 1999. In 2005, Suzanne’s cookbook, Sunday Suppers at Lucques, was published to great reviews. In 2006, the James Beard Foundation acknowledged Suzanne’s culinary achievements, first with the award for “Best Chef California” in 2006, and she subsequently received four concurrent nominations for “Outstanding Chef of the Year” from the Foundation between 2008 – 2011. Suzanne has served as the official caterer for the annual Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards for the past two years. Most recently, Suzanne was honoured to prepare a dinner for United States President Obama at Tavern during a recent official visit to Los Angeles. About Singapore Airlines’ International Culinary Panel: Singapore Airlines’ International Culinary Panel was set up in 1998. Comprising award-winning chefs of global stature, the Panel works closely with the Airline’s own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available for customers in all three classes on board. The Panel of internationally celebrated chefs currently includes Alfred Portale of the United States, Georges Blanc of France, Matthew James Moran of Australia, Sam Leong of Singapore, Sanjeev Kapoor of India, Suzanne Goin of the United States, Yoshihiro Murata of Japan, and Zhu Jun of China. http://www.singaporeair.com/jsp/cms/...s/ne110630.jsp ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.66851806640625, 0.33148193359375]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Amenity kits are really ""practical"" kits that need to ""perform"". Instead it has deteriorated to some ""snooty"" junket gift that SQ thinks may enhance our status because you got it travelling First Class with them with all the brand names. Most of the time, these kits get thrown out upon landing. There should be no rule on how many is allowed or what is allowed when travelling in First or Biz. Just some good quality products that one can use either on board to make it more comfortable and freshen up on arrival as that's what paying the premium and travelling on First is all about!! Another example of ""bean counting"" and destroying the special qualities of what SQ used to be!!!

" From the KF website : If you have at least 50% of the KrisFlyer miles required to redeem for an award ticket, you may purchase the additional miles required to top-up your KrisFlyer account at US$40 (or the local currency equivalent) per block of 1,000 miles, using your credit card. You can purchase the top-up miles while you are making your online redemption booking. The purchase is effected immediately if the transaction is done online. Firstly I noted that you now only need 50% (used to be 70% ?) Secondly, does the underlined sentence mean that you can purchase extra miles during an online upgrade and get the benefit of the 15% online redemption discount? I'm sure I was previously told that if you need to purchase extra miles, you cannot get the 15% discount. The question relates to getting upgrades, not reward tickets. TIA for any info.

I do believe that it is not Solitaire people are making a run for but Lifetime Solitaire and I think Guy Betsy is trying to understand how much of a benefit it really is and is it worth it spending that much time and money considering how much all that would buy you otherwise, but we all have different priorities, for some it's worth it for some not. In the end it really is an individual decision. There might be privileges to come we might not be aware of yet.

TPR is at the back of the SKL F, not the Krisflyer Lounge which is in a different location altogether. You will get your BP's, walk straight to the dedicated FCL immigration then after you pass that and enter T3 the SKL's are up the escalators slightly to the left. Go to the White Ladies at the entrance and show them your Gold TPR invitation, or just your Red F BP if you want to pocket the Gold invite like many do. One of the White Ladies will then escort you through the SKL F to TPR the entrance to which is tucked away on the left at the back of the SKL F.

" Originally posted by Kyo View Post In Singapore, restaurants (alot, but don't think there's any particular card that is heads and shoulders above the other), cinemas, car and airlines, misc. Overseas, restaurants, hotels and the occassional airplane ticket. I mean, the amount spent is probably huge enough that even though we shop at Cold Storage, it wouldn't make a huge difference if we changed to NTUC. We use PremierMiles for the occasional grocery bill thanks to the Visa Paywave, and everything else goes on the Prestige Mastercard. Will look into ANS Travel Signature but it seems like it's about to be neutered. If the restaurants you dine at are not hotel restaurants and they accept AMEX, go for UOB Preferred AMEX. 4 miles/ $ is a good enough reason for me to. For cinemas, if you are a regular GV non-3D patron and have a HSBC credit card, go get the $85 HSBC GV movie card (loaded with 10 tickets) from any GV cinema. Air tickets, it used to be ANZ (2.8 miles). But you can still get 2.8 miles at these travel related merchants. https://sg.anz.com/apps/anz-travel-c...iles-partners/ Or you can use UOB Prvi if you don't have any avenue that beats 8 miles/ $5 (or 1.6miles/ dollar). Another useful card to have: DBS WORLD (not Plat) Woman's MasterCard. 4 miles/ $ for online spend. (Beware that most official hotel chains are not online, your booking is still manually processed. It just looks like it is an online purchase) Citi Rewards: 4 miles/ $ if the merchants is a department store (Takashimaya/ Isetan/ Metro etc) or if their main business is selling clothes/ bags/ shoes.

" Well, I went, and there was no gag order, so: It was a little strange, because they had a bunch of PPS members there, but 99% of the discussion was about mileage redemption/availability in general, with nothing really PPS-specific. And it got tedious after a while because we kept getting (unsubtly) steered back to that topic when we tried to discuss other aspects of the PPS program. Still, they do seem to be genuinely interested in making improvements to KrisFlyer. The Good: There might be more flexibility in the way miles can be redeemed. The Bad (or good?): Probably no changes in lounge access, PPS accrual, etc. P.S. T, if you're on here, sorry for running off - I hope you got a cab!

A record in my opionion! I believe SQ is handled by Jardine Airport Services in HKG, so they don't know how to do the above. You can go to the your KrisFlyer/PPS profile and add your BD number to it. When making reservations, all you have to do is give them only the BD number, and SQ's system will automatically append your Krisflyer/PPS number for PPS value purposes. Note: The boarding pass will print with the SQ Krisflyer/PPS number. But miles will automatically post to BD.

Being impatient, I called 62238888 using another phone and selected English then SQ Suites/First/Business class. It is definitely the ICC as I can hear from the way the person speak, and there are loud background noises with other Indian agents speaking as well. I hesitated as I did not want to waste my time and just asked the agent to check if BTC had been ordered for my brother's booking. It turned out that Swedish Multigrain bread + VLML were requested for his flight on SQ828. Hence, I decided to try my luck and asked him to request Roasted Veg + VLML for my booking, as similar to the first booking. He said he tried to do it but failed. However, I pushed him further to check w his supervisor, esp when he had the 'template' for the first booking. I was put on hold for 10+mins and managed to get it done.

It might be a bit weird already thinking about what to eat 3 months ahead but I am just so much looking forward to this. I was wondering whether you could help me choosing good meals as flying SQ in premium classes might not happen that soon again. I don't want to miss out on anything, so please please please give me your recommendations and feel free to tell me if I made not so good choices - sometimes I tend to overlook things I have to say that I am open to everything so odering from the menu is great for me as well. I just have to add that I am still a seafood newbie: I can eat certain fish and stuff but abalone and other weird sea food stuff is still not really possible for me. I know I am missing out on so much but I am doing my best to enjoy all the good foods the world can offer me My dearest flo, You are not alone. I have been pondering as well what to have on board once I am ungrounded next year. Even when I was traveling heavily, I thought about the food on my future flights! Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 25 FRA - SIN C I think I have two meals on this flight: lunch after departure from Frankfurt and breakfast before landing in Singapore, right? I was planning to tell the FA to serve me the BTC instead of the breakfast so that I have two full meals ... I hope that's even possible. Anyway, here are my favorites ex-Frankfurt: 1. Pan-fried fillet of beef in three peppercorn sauce with garden vegetables and roasted potatoes 2. Artichoke-tomato crusted loin of lamb in thyme sauce, French beans with bacon, and gratin potatoes 3. Salmon gratinated with feta and parmesan cheese in orange ginger sauce with vegetables and Mississippi rice 4. Honey glazed duckling with vegetables and Chinese egg noodles My favorite from FRA is always the lamb. Somehow the crust of artichoke and tomato creates a different taste of the lamb. And yes, I love French beans. Second choice would be the beef. It's just because it's European meat. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 876 SIN - TPE C I will be pretty stuffed from the FRA-SIN flight before but I will try to eat everything I can get hehe. Here are my favorites ex-Singapore: 1. Roast lamb chops with mint jus, mesclun salad, and thyme-flavoured gratin potatoes 2. 6 oz. U.S. rib-eye steak with creamy green peppercorn sauce, roasted vegetables, and garlic-mashed potatoes 3. Pan-seared Chilean bass with bouillabaisse sauce, capsicum confit, and kalamata olive potato I like the lamb, once again. Beef as the second option. But if I want to be a pita on board, i.e. decide to have the choice from the menu, I will get the beef for the BTC, and will tell the FA to have the beef. It seems the crew loves the beef. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 877 TPE - SIN F My first F meal ... yum ... yumm ... yummmmmm ! Ex-Taipei ... a hard one so I thought about not BTC'ing except there is something I absolutely cannot miss taipeiflyer should be the best person to give an advice for ex-TPE whether to BTC or not to BTC. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 12 SIN - NRT F 1. Roast rack of lamb with mint jus, mesclun salad, and thyme-flavoured gratin potatoes 2. Lobster Thermidor with buttered asparagus, slow-roasted vine-ripened tomato, and saffron rice 3. Pan-fried veal loin and braised veal cheek with parsnip purée, garden vegetables, and sautéed mushrooms Again, I always order the lamb or the beef personally. As I mention many times, not fond of lobster thermidor ex-SIN due to the flood of mushrooms on the sauce. In the past year, I have not ordered chicken rice as BTC since it seems the BTC chicken rice is too dry. Also, SQ12 departs after 9am. I will enjoy heavy breakfast at the lounge such as dim sum or noodle soups. I will get my fix of chicken rice while I am in transit in Singapore. And yes, the meals served onboard SQ12 SIN-NRT would be about lunch time. Thus, I want something a bit heavier which lamb or beef will serve me well. Originally posted by flo View Post SQ 12 NRT - LAX F 1. Lobster Thermidor with buttered zucchini, carrots, and pilaff rice with mixed peppers 2. Pan-fried sea bass wrapped with potato, served with red-vinegar sauce and white beans Thanks a lot! Jhm is right on the dot. (No.. it is not dot dot dot ) I love beef sukiyaki ex-NRT. It's not really a soup. It is something like sauce. Anyhow, you may try to have lobster thermidor ex-NRT. So far, it is always the best I had. But if on the menu there is kuro buta (pork) I will keep my BTC for the meals prior to land at LAX. Lastly, it would be great help if others have posted the menu for your flights.

Once you step into our airport, be fascinated as this airport has won numerous awards these past few years. SQ285/286 is a popular sector due to the timing thus the aircraft used is the B777-300ER. Are you in business class? If you are, you will be enjoying a fully flat bed. There will be direct access to the aisle for every seat as the configuration is 1-2-1. Also, the entertainment of movies & music will be much more than the B777-200ER. These seats & entertainment similarly are found on our existing A380, A345 as well as A330 which proved popular with SQ customers. As for SQ282, yes, the beds are SpaceBed in Business class, similar to those found on the 747 jumbo. The seat configuration of this aircraft will be 2-2-2. Hi Chesty, My turn to reply your message. Are you in business or economy firstly? If you are in business, it is a sleeper service, meaning to enable passengers to sleep longer & have undisturbed rest, only 1 meal will be served. Thus a full meal supper is served. If you are in economy, no sleeper service, thus 2 meals will be served, Supper + Breakfast (Menu will indicate ""Before Touch Down"" Menu). If you prefer other flights serving 2 meals, it will be SQ238 and SQ228. Just fyi from 29 Sep onwards, the A380 will be operating on SQ228 on a daily basis. Thanks Feb01mel. I am in J class so just the one meal. I could have gone one of the other flights but really wanted to try the new business class product as its my first time in J with SQ. Also travelling next month so miss out on the A380 but do get the 747 on the way back. At least with the Supper I will get to enjoy the full dining experience by the sounds of it.

I'm presuming there's an option during the redemption booking to click a tickbox saying ""I'll send in the faxback miles purchase form shortly"" as part of the booking or similar? This is a known chicken and egg problem with KF, but there's a way around it. Write in to KF using the buy miles form, and tell them which award you intend to redeem and then buy the miles first. Then do the booking. Originally posted by nickbot View Post Fingers crossed, we're going to try to redeem miles before any 77W-esque double redemption mileage rules come in for the A380, and take a gamble on securing seats in A380 Business Class on the LHR-SIN-SYD-SIN-LHR route (SIN-SYD-SIN in particular) towards the end of March next year before the A380 schedule is announced. I'm conscious that time is against us, so want to act on this ASAP! Any help would, of course, be very much appreciated You may be out of luck on this one. Firstly, by March, I'm not sure if ALL the LHR routes will be 380'ed. Whilst inventory is not blocked yet, you'll have to guess, and that's a 1 in 3 chance you'll get at least one flight on the 380, and a 1 in 9 (I think) chance you'll get both. The 2nd is that SIN-SYD-SIN is pretty much going to be SQ221/220 (there are 3 a day) - Award inventory in business has been blocked since May of this year - and is blocked for as far out as I can see. By march, I don't think you'll have both or all three of the SYD services 380'ed, as the next deliveries of the planes are going to be dedicated to running a daily to LHR (and you need a minimum of 2 frames, or 3 frames if you want a spare for safety, to run daily LHR) ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.587925136089325, 0.41207486391067505]",amenity_catering_lounges

" I'm guessing you are referring to SQ Krisflyer Miles? Well, good news - there are plenty of places you can go if you elect to redeem flights. For a complete list, log into your KF account at www.singaporeair.com Next, look for 'Loyalty Programs' at the top - hover your mouse over it and it will change yellow - one of the options below that will appear is 'Redeem Miles'. Click 'Redeem Miles'. On your left you have a few choices, which you should spend some time familiarising yourself with. Normally if you have no idea where to go - you would click 'My Travel Planner'. Select 'Round Trip' or 'One Way' (most likely 'Round Trip', I'm guessing) and click on 'Go'. Now you can see a complete list of places you can go (sorted out by First, Business or Economy Class) - including Saver, Standard and Full awards. To maximise your miles, look for the Saver awards. Remember, if you book online, normally you get 15% 'off' miles required to redeem an award. But even better still is now you can do it for 25% off due to a system-wide promotion SQ is having. Additionally, if you really wanted to maximise your miles and are fairly flexible about the dates of your travel, you could go back to: ""Next, look for 'Loyalty Programs' at the top - hover your mouse over it and it will change yellow -"" This time, look for a white box saying 'Celebrating Krisflyer's 10th Anniversary'. If you look closely to the right, you can click a link for more details. SQ is having a big promotion: ""From 1 Feb to 15 Sep 09, instead of the usual 15%, enjoy 25% off all online redemptions and 50% off online redemptions on selected flights. Terms and conditions apply."" Choose carefully, calculate where you can go and subtract the 50% off miles required to redeem an award booking.

" Hi all, While I am not new to flying on SQ I am new to redeeming on them. I am looking at redeeming a number of awards for hopefully 4 Business Class seats at a time....in the main hopefully using Savers even though this narrows choice. I have recently made redemption for 4 MEL -Vietnam over Xmas and there was a wide choice of days. However ""testing"" out other destinations it would seem that 4 seats on the one flight is hard to get. I can normally ""see"" 2 seats. But 4 in the main does not come up. To ""test"" availability I have been making dummy booking at the maximum number of days out. I am looking to fly from Melbourne to say Rome, Manchester, Istanbul or Athens. I have seen some availability to Athens. I am ""testing"" now as I am looking to go to Europe in July 2010....and again in Dec/Jan 2010. Both trips will be to Europe, but will be to different cities. So some questions: Are 4 business seats at once often, or normally, available or is 2 the normal amount? if yes is it just that bookings go quickly and so I am not seeing availability for this reason? Is it that on the maximum number of days out that 4 seats are not available, but may become available later? Does availability in terms of 2 or 4 seats very by time of year? If so when is tightest? Now if two is the normal limit one strategy is to fly 2 each on different days. However I would prefer not to do this.

" Hi all, A couple of my planned work trips are looking to be delayed a month or two, leaving me in possible need of 1.25 sectors by end-Feb to tap me into re-qual. Given my recent experience and what I'm reading here about the slow depreciation of PPS benefits, I'm inclined to give SQ the minimum of my own $. So essentially I'm looking for the cheapest possible 1.25 sectors, ex-SIN. Am currently looking at: SIN-HKT or CNX on Tiger, and HKT-SIN on MI J-class; SIN-JKT on JetStar, and JKT-SIN on SQ J-class; SIN-BKK on Tiger or JetStar, and BKK-SIN on SQ J-class.

It is still a decent product. It is also cheaper with 15% discount. And for FRA, they may change the plane in the near future. You can then get cheap flights to your final destination.

So I log into my kris flyer account on the Silkair website which went back up today and there it says that it wasn't booked through Silkair so I can't choose my seats... It was booked through Singapore Air because the Silkair website was down for over a month and there was no other way to book online!!

Nick V-Flyer.com Interesting thought, but given that SQ owns more of Virgin Atlantic (49%) than Virgin Atlantic owns of Virgin America (25% indirectly via Branson), one would hope that at least SQ manages to maintain access to VS lounges for its passengers, even if other airlines are booted out to accomodate VA pax.

 Well a quick update on that elusive C Saver seat SIN-DPS that I waitlisted for about 3 weeks ago. This morning at 8am SIN time my phone beeped and my GF already looked suspiciously at me wondering who could send me a SMS at that time (no idea where she gets those thoughts from ). Low and behold it was from SQ telling me that her C Saver waitlist had cleared. So I told her that it looks like she will be going 'in style' to DPS to which I got a '... better be' and a faint smile. Guess I spoilt that one already ... But i digress. The flight is in Mid-May and I waitlisted Mid-March to clear waitlist about 3 weeks later. I'm KF Blue so no special priority here.

" At a basic level, computers deal with data in the form of bytes (8 bits each). If you only use one byte (8 bits) to store a number (ignoring negative values and floating point decimal numbers), you go from 0 to a maximum of 255 as shown above. If you use two bytes (16 bits) to store a number (ignoring negative values and floating point decial numbers), you go from 0 to a maximum of 65,535. (This explains why some old computers could only have a maximum of 64K of memory (without tweaking) because they addressed everything using 16 bits, i.e. 1111111111111111 = 65,535 = 64 * 1024 = 64K.) Now a programmer may have made a decision that nobody would get more than 255 PPS sectors, so store the value in one byte rather than use two bytes (thereby saving a byte of storage for each PPS member)! Whilst computers nowadays have gigabytes of memory (where 1 gigabyte = 1,024 x 1,024 x 1,024 bytes), using an extra byte of storage for each record isn't a problem but not that long ago, you were talking about kilobytes of memory (where 1 kilobyte = 1,024 bytes) for your typical computer! Of course as SuperJonJon says, it's not likely but ... on the other hand, programmers years ago thought that it was unlikely that their programs would be around after the year 1999 so stored dates as (say) ""98"" rather than ""1998"" giving rise to the year 2000 problem! If programmed badly, an overflow would mean that the counter resets to zero, i.e. the year 1999 plus 1 year = the year 1900!

You decide for yourself if you want to take the risk if the new rewards catalogue in 2014, they increase the number of blocks of miles to transfer again.

BKK - LAX = 8,260, BKK - CGK = 1,439 if you do LAX - CGK before 31-Dec-2011, then additional 9,699 so total is 48,495. you are kind of short of 1505. you can either fly back to us by 31-Dec-2011 or you can do some domestic flight in us using UA or do a CGK-BKK-CGK when you are back during summer time. That's will make you qualify for Gold. Or you can fly back on Premium Economy on LAX-BKK trip during the summer.

Hope thay had enjoyed their F experience beside the part on PJ and amenity kits.. J777, you've assumed too much from what I've written. My brother was not travelling with us. He's not impressed with SQ F from previous flights. He's a NH guy. My mom did not touch or open the kit. She guessed that there would be bottles of goodies inside because my brother and I had briefed her prior to the flight. I am guessing that she was given the kit (with the bottles of goodies) based on what she told me - a cream bag placed on the side (near the screen or somewhere?). Mom is not very specific when she speaks (and so am I ). The truth is she was not sure if she could take the kit. Based on what she's told me, the FA just 'dumped' it at the side without addressing her. Personally I think a comment such as 'Ms XXX/Mdm XXX, this kit is for you' would be more polite and would suffice. But apparently, there was no verbal exchange between them. Sounds like the pile of work your work colleagues would dump at your side at work, expecting you to know it's for you. Unimpressed. As for PJs, they were definitely not distributed to the passengers SIN-NRT. Mom heard a gentleman asking for them specifically. Anyway, mom reckons that PJs are only necessary for the NRT-LAX passengers. (SQ should really employ her since she's so penny pinching on behalf of SQ!) She and my brother share the NH mentality, so no 'stealing' PJs! Well, I never said I was particularly bright. Girls take after their mothers after all, so ... OT comment, I was eavesdropping to a Japanese lady and her male (gaijin) companion over lunch this afternoon. She was telling her male friend what a good mother she would be (she takes after her mother, mother was very good with kids, etc etc), then in the next sentence she asked him if he loves her!

" My worst experience was on a SAS flight to CPH from SIN. At the BKK stopover, a seriously drunk came onboard and sat next to me in J, mumbling all sorts of expletives as he got into his seat, and sounding as if he just visited some whorehouse just before taking the flight. He stank of alcohol and heavens-know-what but the killer moment was when he took off his shoes. I went into immediate involuntary retroperistalsis. Thank goodness I didn't eat much on the SIN-BKK leg. Despite this event happening more than a decade ago, it is indelibly etched into my memory.

" So, I've investigated a little bit more, and while I can't be certain, here's what I think I know: Y to J upgrades are going to be very difficult. There are plenty of flights where you just can't redeem them (I think this is going to be every 77W and 388 at least, possibly others), because SQ will never release them to Star Alliance partners. The fare conditions summary near the bottom of the page as you're booking a flight on the SQ website will tell you whether you can use Star Alliance miles to upgrade your flight. J to F upgrades on the other hand seem to be wide-open. Any J flight can be upgraded to F, subject to availability, of course. And this seems to be the most appealing part of it: J to F upgrades on SQ seem to be very cheap using LifeMiles.

" Originally posted by SQ228 View Post I've got two elderly unwell parents in Europe who are booked through a travel agent on tours and their flights back are with EK. Unsure how flexible their tickets are because it is all bound up in travel agent packaging. If the worst case scenario happens and they just want to walk away from their whole package and be flown home and travel insurance won't play ball, they then may find it hard to find seats home with Europe all departing on holidays about now. If I need to rescue them, can anyone advise if I can use Elite Gold status to call SQ and ask to gift my miles to them and have them priority waitlisted in any way? My specialty is timetabling and flight schedules- ticketing isn't my area of knowledge so I thought I'd ask for a couple of tips from my friends on here. Yup they will need to have a KrisFlyer account first and then you will need to add them as your redemption nominee. Unlike other airlines you can't use your miles for others other than your redemption nominee. SQ permits you to have up to 5 and they charge for editing / removing them if less than a certain period. Once they are added to your redemption nominee you can start making bookings for them. Waitlist is another ball game as your status may not be applicable to them but since you are booking for them you can try to contact SQ for assistance.

 I now make sure that I carry my relevant card when accessing a lounge through status as I have been asked to show my card on so many ocassions with so many different airlines. With BA at LHR it is a must as the status on your boarding pass could be out of date. When showing my relevant card I have never had a problem. The only time I have had a problem was trying to bring a guest into the SKL when travelling F. They were refusing access for a guest. I asked them to go and check the access rules. The lady went away and came back and said this time she would bend the rules and allow me guest. I still said not good enough I want you to acknowledge that I am allowed a guest. She finally admitted that I was allowed a guest. A couple of days later I was back in the SKL travelling LH in F even though the lounge was much fuller they were very happy to allow me two guests (Maybe because they could charge LH). Even though I have had a few problems I would say I have never met a lounge dragon as they have always been very polite and friendly (just not always very well informed). ,"['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.7487964630126953, 0.2512034773826599]",amenity_catering_lounges

SIN<=>HKG 1.25 sectors + HKG<=>SFO 5 sectors? Is it becasue it's a transit stop at the HKG airport, you just waiting at te lounge for an hour & then depart again, you won't get the extra 1.25 sector? Or is it a compulsory to stay at HKG more than 24 hours that it will qualify as a stopover but not the transit stop so that you can earn an extra 1.25 sectors?

" skooby, I sympathize with you that your bodyclock isn't easy to fool. I assume you'll be on London time? I can never get a decent amount of sleep on SQ317 because my body thinks it's supposed to be awake for most of the flight. Having said that, I think the snack options can be rather substantial in Business Class; they go beyond just fruit, crisps and chocolate bars. I recall one time when the wrap contained what seemed like the equivalent of the satay chicken. (It was also served warmed ). There are also noodle soups on offer. You won't be limited in the number of snacks you ask for, so just ask whenever you start feeling peckish. From my experience, two C class snacks easily made up for the 'missing' meal. Have a decent breakfast (meal #1) on the ground [that's what I used to use the VS CH for]; you'll have the full C class lunch onboard; two snacks to tide you over; and then you have the breakfast, which can be rather substantial as well. Consider this last meal a very late dinner. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.6759262681007385, 0.32407376170158386]",amenity_catering_lounges

Drink plenty of water an hour before your flight and drink plenty of water on board. 2.) If you're travelling east go to bed earlier (If you would go to bed at 11pm, make it 10pm) for a couple of nights. If you're travelling west just do it the other way round. (you probably will not get much sleep, but just try) 3.) Have a early night the day before the flight, if you can. 4.) Exercise while on the plane, walk around the plane a lot. (If you have been doing step 1 you should be doing this alot anyway ) 5.) Go to the gym when you arrive or take a long walk. 6.) Try to get into the daily routine of the new time zone as soon as possible. Eat, sleep (taking step 2 into account) and get up when everone else does in that time zone. 7.) On long trips take a multivitamin before and after the flight. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.7197286486625671, 0.2802712619304657]",amenity_catering_lounges

" It has always been my view that PPS is the model for airline loyalty. Particularly in status-conscious Asia, PPS is an just-attainable goal that generates premium (P & J) revenue and often fanatical customer loyalty. PPS, if anything, is a victim of its success. It has engendered loyalty among ever increasing numbers of premium passengers. If there is a need to control this success, I can empathise with this. By all means, raise the bar -- BUT give something more to those who remain. Raising the bar AND cutting the benefits makes no sense at all. From my perspective as a corporate traveller, I still have full control of which carrier I fly. I hope very much that SQ does not act with the arrogance to think that they can demand more dollars, and at the same time reward this loyalty with less.

After some time on hold while the agent checked on this, he said that this was still under review and could not give me a definitive answer right now! That's... surprising? Not ideal? I guess we'll have to wait until they figure it out. One would have thought that they had nailed this down before announcing the changes... I do concur that not being able to waitlist anymore in the T-14 window would be a negative change, but then again, if they do allow it, what's to stop you from re-waitlisting immediately? That would undo the whole (supposed) point of the T-14 cutoff. A bit off topic, but here it is. I found that the call centre recently has been very unprofessional and uninformed. Once I was told that the qualifying period will be uniformed to dec 2018, and that I will receive email about it in due course and that they received a lot of complaints regarding this change. Of course no email came and my qualifying period remains november. My worries was completely in vain. Also on that same phone call, my elite mileage was 54000 and the agent told me to fly further 6000 to get that elite gold rewards at 60000 miles. Little did she know that it only applies to SQ flights, which mine stand at around 23000. She also sounded confident when I told her I took half of my flights with ANA “no sir, you will get your reward if you fly another 6000 miles) Can they just stick to simpler rules like it was before.

" Originally posted by HUGE AL View Post KeithMEL, another awesome poster... Many thanks. You're welcome. Originally posted by HUGE AL View Post So, what's your opinion on this FFP issue...UA, LH, BD, SQ, etc? They each have their advantages and disadvantages. Just briefly: UA is great if you fly UA a lot but otherwise, as you've noted - zero COS bonus on partners (except for LH tatl flights I think... not sure about this one). According to the screams of protest on the UA board on FT, it can be tough using UA miles on partners. BD offers very good earn/burn, particularly with Cash+Miles. You also get decent accrual on premium cabins (though not as good as M+M). BD*G is very achievable with 57000 miles required at the first go, and 38 000 to requalify. Get a status match (comparably easy to achieve) and you need not bother about the initial 57 000 miles ,only the 38k. I wouldn't be concerned about BD collapsing anytime soon as they show no signs of doing so and on the contrary, hold very valuable slots at LHR. LH - what I currently use. Am pretty happy with it. You can scroll through this thread to read everything that;s been said about it thus far. LH has a very rigid zone system. The zone system works to your advantage if you can find a direct way to get from one zone to another, but otherwise 3 zone awards are expensive for the shorter journeys. And of course - status lasts for 2 years. SQ - yep miles expire after 3 years, and there's nothing you can do to prevent them from expiring. The advantage of using Krisflyer is the ability to upgrade on SQ tickets, which enables upgrades on cheaper fare buckets than *A upgrades.

" Fuel surcharge now counts toward PPS Value Just received the email: Over the past year we have embarked on a series of revamps to serve you better and we hope that you have had the opportunity to benefit from some of these changes. In particular, we were encouraged by your positive response to the improvements made to our award charts, which now offer you the opportunity to redeem Saver awards in any of our cabin classes, including the Singapore Airlines Suites. Also, you can now enjoy the added benefit of earning miles even on attractive promotional fares in Economy Class. As a step further, we are pleased to inform you that you will be able to earn PPS Value on the fuel surcharge component of your ticket, in addition to the airfare, when you travel in the Singapore Airlines Suites, First or Business Class on Singapore Airlines or SilkAir. This means that the amount you pay for fuel surcharge will now count towards your PPS Value and re-qualification as a PPS Club member. This change will be applicable for all eligible flights departing from 1 July 2013 regardless of when the booking was made. For more information, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions below. This change has come about as a result of the valuable feedback we have received from you and it has helped us greatly in planning for improvements to the programme.

" I was digging through my old things the other day and came across something interesting, my old young explorer passport. For the uninitiated, young explorer was the programme that SIA had for young kids aged 12 or under back in the early to mid 1990s. I'm not sure what's happened to it but I'm quite sure it went the way of Elvis, the Beatles and Stephen Forshaw a long time ago. My dad had to fly to the US (SFO) very often for business and my family would tag along. My sister and I would present our young explorer cards at the desk and feel all grown up as the check in agent (they actually cared about their jobs back then) importantly handled our cards first and credited miles to our account (they even had their own tier system for young explorer, i think the more miles you flew the better gifts you were eligible for. like a pencil case. or a water bottle. no krug though) I remember in the days before 9/11 they were much laxer with security on the plane. Sometimes the door to the cockpit would even be left open. We would be on the 747 and on the upper deck, and at some point in the flight the stewardess would come up to us and ask us if we wanted to go see the captain. Of course we did, and the captain would entertain us for about 15 minutes or so, pointing at various knobs and buttons before signing our passport book, which was to certify that we had travelled the miles. Then one day I turned 13 and they sent me a blue krisflyer card, and my childhood ended there. Oh woe. Anyone here still remembers this?

" Originally posted by SQ222 View Post It appears to me that once I had contributed to SQ coffers that xxx amount, I will be PPS: .... regardless of the timing of the flights (??? true) No. As stated above in the quote taken from SQ, the accrual is within 12 calendar months. What the website is doing is calculating the $value from present to 12 months ago and show you the balance needed to hit $25K. Originally posted by SQ222 View Post .... before my renewal date (??? true) Again, let me state that it has NOTHING to do with your current renewal date to achieve PPS. However once you do achieve it, you will need to hit $25K again within 12 calendar months from the month you got into PPS (new renewal date) but don't let this muddle you for now. Originally posted by SQ222 View Post I am rather surprised to see your view that the segments need to be flown to be counted towards PPS. May I ask if you could refer me to some T & C somewhere, if possible ? All this is rather new to me, really. Regards Like Miles, PPS$ is credited post-flight, not at point of purchase. Why? When you pay for them, yes, the money is with SQ but as with many (not all) unflown flights, you can always cancel it and get back your money. If they had awarded you PPS when you bought the tickets, but you cancel the flight after that (intentionally?), would SQ then have to withdraw your PPS? Way too messy. So the policy of awarding post-flight is sound, SQ has earned your money when you actually fly and then they can give you the award. Hope that explains it. Most of what you need to know is found HERE. It's not all-encompassing but it is clear and simple enough. NOTE: Sorry this post looks as if KFly's and TerryK's explanation wasn't sufficient.

The tomato soup was quite good too. I had the BTC lamb chops with mint jelly; the lamb was tasty enough but the portion was a bit on the smallish side. I think I skipped dessert and went for the cheeses. Then they told me they had run out of Bordeaux (everyone was drinking it!), so I went with the Seqouia Grove cab (a decent cab but certainly not the best of Napa and not really Bordeaux-style). The bread basket was particularly good on this flight, with a large flat bread encrusted with parmesan cheese. After takeoff from Hong Kong, I really didn't want to eat dinner again, so I asked them to just serve the soup and hold onto everything else so I could have it closer to San Francisco. The mushroom soup was disappointing, not much flavor. So I knocked back a few more glasses of Bordeaux--the turbulence off Kyushu forced me to drink fast, lest I spill--and went to sleep for nearly 8 hours. Waking up from that, a big veal chop wasn't really appetizing. So I had the breakfast menu-- yoghurt good enough though tart, and I think I had the eggs.

Krisflyer tried to give me a silver, and an easy way to regain gold, but I think I should politely decline.

" Originally posted by YK@HKG View Post Is the burning rate more worthwhile for LH miles on SQ flights? If that's the case, I will try to credit my next SQ flights on M&M. That would depend. M+M classifies awards into regions and if you can a direct flight from ** zone of origin to the zone ** destination falls into - it can be quite worthwhile. As with all Star Alliance awards you also get the 1 enroute stop for free. M+M also limits you to no more than 6 coupons for a return journey - you're allowed more for the RTW awards. I ran into an issue with regions when I last spent my miles. I was trying to redeem an award to PVG. An Australia/NZ/Oceania to North Asia award costs 90 000 miles in Business, rather good value IMO. Now of course there aren't any direct flights since SQ hubs at SIN, which falls into South East Asia. If I'd insisted on such an award on SQ, it'd become a 3 region award (Australia/NZ/Oceania-SEA-North Asia), which means I'd need 160 000 miles for virtually the same award. I ended up redeeming Air NZ Business Premier MEL-AKL-PVG return for 90 000 miles. On the other hand you could do quite well if your award originates in South East Asia, and you wanted to get to Australia/NZ/Oceania - you could get a very nice trip out of redeeming an SQ flight to NZ, use ** enroute stop to check out NZ, then continue on an Air NZ flight to any South Pacific destination including Fiji, Tahiti, Noumea etc. And the cost of all that would be 90 000 miles in business.

" Premium Originally posted by stargold View Post Most importantly, you have to remember the following: 1. People generally like SQ and prefer to fly SQ on a reward flight 2. The ""FFP airline"" (e.g. UA for Mileage Plus) has to ""pay"" SQ for the reward flight 3. If SQ has policies preventing redemption by other Star FFP members on SQ, it means those other Star airlines do not have to ""pay"" SQ So, the other airlines are not going to be in a particular hurry to pressurise SQ to open up 77W/380/345 rewards to other Star FFP, because doing so will only increase the liability towards SQ. I suppose it's my cynical side talking, but I'm sure the above plays no small part in why the situation has been allowed to go on for so long. So there is a conspriracy between the airlines to, essentially, eliminate redemption travel, especially premium redemption travel? Is that what y6ou are saying?

With default settings to update or sync over wifi (and only over cell data if you choose to). For example, I set my phone to update the apps over wifi at night, so if I take a night flight with wifi, it automatically does that the moment the wifi internet connects, and there goes my free/paid allowances. Also, after 1 hour+ of no syncing (taxi + take off until cruising altitude), the syncing once data is back should take quite some data too.

My suggestion : when you receive the voucher, use it ASAP to enjoy the miles, then worry about the annual fee later.

More complex itineraries e.g. 4 sectors + open jaw + purchased in foreign currency from an outstation, or even including mixed cabins in one ticket can cause the PPS $ to take much longer to post. However, they do come in eventually so I wouldn't be too worried in the long run. That's consistent with my experience too. Another scenario that significantly delays things is bookings with changes involving changes in fare/travel class. These can take up to 2-3 weeks to clear in some cases.

" Originally posted by jhm View Post 4 The ending needs to be strong - e.g. suggesting/telling SQ of the impact on their bottom line (the only thing which they'll care about) - rather than some vague hint that we might bank our miles elsewhere (SQ says big deal!) or consider taking some other airline. While a strong ending with a numerical estimate of the shift in spending would be nice, I'm not sure how credible such a number would be, unless people turned in the receipts from their re-bookings as an exhibit to the letter. In addition, for many of us, it's just too early to tell how much shifting will occur. I don't fly SQ regularly enough that I have upcoming business trips which I could shift to other airlines for immediate impact. Finally, because we do fly SQ partly because it happens to serve the destinations we go to, possibly the most frequent reaction might just be to shift to a less miserly FFP. Peanuts, yes, but it means KrisFlyer doesn't get payments from my *A flights whereas the partner FFP would, including my SQ flights. More important, SQ loses a good source of customer data, as well as a touchpoint with its customers. In the joint letter, IMO, a qualitative threat can certainly make the point, having been signed by members who have status with the airline. The airline should be able to tell what that could mean for its business. If individuals want to calculate the shift in their personal spending, they can definitely include that in their communication. (Before, I would have asserted some confidence that SQ would care about the effect on its intangible assets, like customer loyalty and brand equity, and the long-term impact on revenue growth. But these days I'm less confident about that.) ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.8221588134765625, 0.1778412163257599]",krisflyer

" Originally posted by ozdude View Post I go to Japan and Korea once a year on separate trips from SG and am thinking of dropping Krisflyer. SQ econ upgradable flights are now at least 1500SGD compared to 1000SGD with ANA and Asiana. Bit too much to pay for the pleasure of upgrading for a 6.5 hour flight. So I am considering TG, Asiana, or ANA for FFP. I am leaning towards TG as going to Europe with them would not be a hassle, plus they seem to have reasonable promos every now and then. Any thoughts? Is there any benefit staying with KF? The main reason I have used them is the Amex Krisflyer card, while it may not have the best rates, I have done pretty well over the years accumulating miles for normal spend. Having said that, if I go to one of those other programs mentioned above, are there credit cards I can use in SG for decent accrual? I'd prefer to keep flying SQ, but over the last few years the econ prices for regional flights are getting too high. I am KF Gold, fly SQ-Y between here and HKG, Gardua-Y to CGK and TG almost everywhere else, including BUS, FRA, LHR and BKK (obviously) in J with all miles posted to KF. I look at the OZ and TG programs and am almost envious of their privileges: points ratio however......... Credit Cards in SG appoint miles mostly to either KF or AsiaMiles. Citi's PremierMiles card can also post to TG, MH, GA and BA. OCBC, for example only goes to KF. The 25% bonus on the miles I do fly SQ is okay, and the 15% saving on miles redemption online also helps even out the mileage disparity a bit to TG and OZ. Dickson: Thank you for posting. The writer is a bit bias but overall not too far away from the truth. Half of all my Y flights on CX were upgraded to J, long and short haul, and the lounge access, priority baggage, priority check-in and priority boarding as MPC-Silver was a very easy 25000miles. As MPC-Gold there was only two occasions I needed the guaranteed seat facility, but it proved very important when I needed it most. CX management know how to look after loyal guests, and actually view them as an important member of their team rather than a troublesome necessity an airline requires to make profits. If I had a choice, I would fly CX but based in SG, it's impossible to justify. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.652777373790741, 0.3472226858139038]",krisflyer

With the launch of this latest initiative, PPS Club and KrisFlyer members will have the choice and flexibility to redeem all award types in all cabin classes across the Singapore Airlines network. We will be revising our award charts to include the Singapore Airlines Suites, which will be categorised together with First Class award levels for ease of reference. Despite this change there will not be an increase in the current Saver Award levels for First Class. All Saver Awards are also now valid for one year instead of six months. There will, however, be an increase in selected Standard and Full Award levels for First Class which will also apply to the Singapore Airlines Suites. For members who have made a prior Standard or Full Award booking for First Class, the original award levels will be honoured for bookings made on or before 28 November 2012 and ticketed by 12 December 2012.

" I just had a look again at the rules and noticed the following (with one big for me!): Members who qualify (and continue to qualify upon renewal) for PPS Club as well as KrisFlyer Elite Silver or KrisFlyer Elite Gold will be accorded the programme privileges for and benefits of the PPS Club. Members are not allowed to accumulate benefits and privileges for both programmes. I don't understand what the last sentence is meant to address ? What benefits are there under KF EG which don't exist under PPS ? Any ideas ? PPS Value Credit Due to regulatory requirements or local market practice in some countries, the amount shown in the ticket fare box is not reflective of the actual amount paid or does no reflect any fare value at all. For tickets purchased in these countries, the PPS Value credited to members will be a fair value approximating the actual amount paid for the tickets. The countries where the exception would apply are: Brunei, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom and Vietnam. Fair to who I wonder! And now... even if a significant duration of the applicable eligibility period for qualification and/or renewal precdes 1 September 2007, Singapore Airlines shall be entitled to assess and determine (in its sole discretion and absolute opinion) a member's eligibility for qualification and/or renewal of PPS Club membership on the basis of the PPS Value if the last day of the applicable eligibility period for qualification and/or renewal is on or after 1 September 2007. I thought my PPS year end is the end of August but ... it's actually the end of September! So I will have requalified with 25 PPS sectors by the beginning of August but because my year ends after 1 September, SQ will be able to determine in its ""sole discretion and absolute opinion"" whether I get a further 12 months of PPS membership ?!?

According to the airline, the trial has been ongoing for the last six months, and a decision has yet to be made in terms of how to improve the boarding process. The reason why we are boarding from the ""normal"" instead of ""priority"" lane is because of complaints from the Solitare, PPS, PCL and JCL pax who found the queue lane too ""long"" for their liking. SIA has confirmed that Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold pax will continue to board with ""priority"" but from the ""normal"" lane.

I'm booked on SQ to fly back to London this Sunday, but decided to cancel the ticket (and incur RM200 penalty) and booked on MH. And then back to Enrich.

Try redeeming the same on SQ...you'll never get one! So long, KF! Another one bites the dust ps - with this, I will also wave goodbye to AMEX KF Charge card! Goodbye.

" hello everyone, I was writing because I was thinking about making a run for solitaire before sept 1, and was wondering if you think it would be worth it for me. i'm qpp1 and my requal date is nov. including my past travels and my current bookings up through aug 31, i will have 187 PPS sectors. however, I am only averaging 363 SGD per sector, because almost all of my flights are tpe-lax. therefore, i was considering making a run at solitaire, because i am getting a very favorable return on my sectors right now with the $1000/sector. i could then take the next year off from SQ and try out some other airlines, while still maintaining PPS. For my flights on SQ, I can use my banked flyer miles. After next year's lay-off, i would then switch most of my travels back to SQ and try to hit the 25,000 SGD and re-claim solitaire. Basically i could flip-flop every other year and still at least maintain PPS. In your opinion, do you think it's worth it for me to go after the extra 63 sectors. The cost-benefit of it is more money up front, but substantial money saved on the back-end.

And book they did.. i hate to place personal judgements as i'm sure some have and likely will be. There is an obvious self vested interest in your comments. Putting that aside, SQ has never historically cancelled any bookings unless its due to credit card integrity issues.Previous fare mistakes resulted in one particular station suspending their own ticket stock, not cancel ticketed bookings. The second-hand comments you posted probably relate to booking system linkage issues, ie as previously noted by UA flyers, disappearing bookings but underlying tickets are intact. This happened previously pre-shares system. Its highly unlikely SQ would be ordering their staff to manually cancel bookings not on their ticket stock. As noted by someone else, the only consequence is that award bookings for KF flyers have been reduced but SQ would have a ""one-time monetary gain"" from industry purchases.

" Allow me to steer off topic a little, My dear moderators Here's my little blog that may be also interesting to some : Just got off a wonderful flight on SQXXX and having read this thread just yesterday. I decided to ask the IFS Mr T. on my flt (quite a senior chap) if he knew or have read the infamous blogsite. He replied as a matter of factly in his nice Singlish slang..oh that one ah? These are stories that we talk about at night stops, some are true and some aren't. Some exaggerated. Take it with a pinch of salt When I asked him about the blogger's background...He said that the management and many senior crew know (or highly suspect) who this EX-Cabin Crew Executive is. I had to ask what the CCE (as they call it) did in the Cabin Crew division. He explained that these were crew who were 'promoted and grounded mostly' after the IFS rank to be trainers and to appraise the flying crew. They also managed the wards/teams. Then a few years back, most of them were given pension or some farewell package (couldn't remember the term he used) and were asked to leave by the company. I was puzzled why and probe further. Well, many of these 'old folks' were sitting around like office managers who lost touch with flying and earning big money, he said. Some were good, but some were just bringing misery to operating crew when they flew with them. He said to cut the story short, many of the bad apples were rid off when majority of the CCE's were asked to leave. Some good ones were retained and are still in the company today. Many of the Ex-CCEs were of course very furious with the sudden move of the company. Some even threatened lawsuit. Others vowed to bad mouth... Some just happily retired Since crew do complain about PITAs pax...I asked IFS Mr T what did most of the crew thought of them (Ex-CCE)..and their absence. He said...GOOD RIDDANCE to those gone. Then again fellow SQTalkers...this is just my story (blog) that I am relating from what I have heard. Pls take it as entertainment (like all blogs) ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5084314346313477, 0.49156859517097473]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Originally posted by taipeiflyer View Post i just thought of a very good way to get an award ticket when you are short the miles. if there is a KF member out there whom you trust and who trusts you, and that person possesses the requisite miles, you ask them to list you as an award redemption nominee. They book the ticket using their miles, and then at a later date, when you have amassed the same amount of miles, you reciprocate. For example, if i want to fly J from SFO-HKG, and I only have 90,000 miles, I will fall short by 3,500 miles. So, if I know someone who possesses at least 93,500 miles, i ask them to list me as an award redemption nominee (you can list up to 5). They book the ticket with their KF miles. After my next paid flight, I would then possess the requisite KF miles to get them a ticket using the same amount of miles.

As far as I can tell, SQ distributes the total fare across all the segments that you have booked for. E.g. if it is a straight retrun trip between two points then you will get half for one way and the other half when you make the return journey. Similarly for multiple segments. After you complete your trip your total for all the individual PPSV should equal the fare (less taxes etc.) paid.

" Let me pinch-hit for Keith while he's away. Double-dipping means you accumulate a partner's award miles, while PPS keeps tabs of your PPS status. To use the M&M example, you're accumulating LH miles towards SQ redemptions, so you have to use LH award charts and also contact LH to redeem those miles. The ability to redeem on SQ flights depends on the availability of seats to partners like LH; SQ tends to free up more seats for KrisFlyer members than for partner FFers. The PPS bonus is only available to you when you bank with KrisFlyer. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.9397485256195068, 0.06025155261158943]",krisflyer

BKK-SIN 14th Feb SIN-SGN 15th Feb They are staying overnight at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport (on 14th Feb) which is outside immigration. They actually want to use the Silver Kris J class lounge for a short while upon arrival in SIN from BKK, however, the lounge is for departing pax only. My parents do not want to stay at the transit hotel inside OR stay overnight in the Silver Kris lounge. So can they at 1) BKK check in, request boarding passes all the way to SGN, & they use the SGN boarding pass to enter Silver Kris lounge in SIN, & then they exit immigration to stay at Crowne Plaza, the next morning they just use the boarding pass for SGN to re-enter immigration again? Will there be any issue? They will have no issue to check in all their baggage from BKK-SGN direct. 2) Alternatively, if they need all their baggage in SIN, can they at BKK check in, request boarding pass for SGN as well, BUT check in baggage only till SIN so they can take their baggage out in SIN & enjoy Silver Kris lounge access at same time upon arrival? 3) Or if 2) NOT permitted, how about another way is at BKK check in counter, only request boarding pass to SIN and baggage just to SIN only, & upon reaching SIN, at Transfer Counter request boarding pass to SGN, then they can use the Silver Kris Lounge, and then they can collect their baggage after that, and the next day just re-enter immigration again using the SGN boarding pass.

" Originally posted by sqdazz View Post TG ROP is not that attractive to me and i fly MEL-BKK return every month. The W and V class fares will go to 0 miles in July in ROP (already 0 in KF). You will have to fly a minimum of Q class to earn anything on TG flights. There goes your 500 miles on TG domestic sectors for the cheap tix. At least with KF on SQ flights on the cheapest fare ex-aus there is always 100% mileage accrual and 25% tier bonus for silver and up. The downsides are there is no upgrade cert's and elite is valid for 12 months only but that doesn't worry me as i fly 50k a year anyway. Now i book J class on TG domestic for about $50 more and accrue on KF. I stick to SQ as much as I can - the Q class on TG mel/bkk is now $1230AU and SQ is usually between $1150 and $1250 for W class. For the same price i rather take the 25% bonus and 15% online reduction in points for award bookings. Plus the SQ website is lovely to use for most functions. There are pros and cons to all programs though The issue here for me that its exactly the reverse. Flying direct to Auckland / Christchurch via SQ would be the most preferred, and I don't even mind that its slightly more expensive, but the problem is, it would have to add around S$500 before I can start claiming miles. With TG, after tax, I'm expected to pay around S$1.3K, but with SQ, I can only start dreaming of flying @ S$1.6K. I can only claim miles if I'm flying for the Q Class Fare, at S$1.8K... SIGH..

" The thing is, with credit card spend, I'd say you're better of keeping KF for the miles derived from that. You can upgrade Y-J a fair amount, but it depends on your card spend. For regional flights, I could find myself upgrading 10-12 times a year (once a month on a regional) based on my spend with Citibank PremierMiles. For your BIS miles, you could always still credit to NH, which could well make your trans-Pac flights *that* much more enjoyable. No CC miles that I'm aware of (hope I'm wrong), but NH does have a current special on less mileage required for redeeming upgrades. Simply put, I think you should maintain KF (I do, myself) by virtue of the odd MI flight and cc spend (also sometimes certain hotel chains for added flexibility, like Accor or Shangri-la etc) and maintain NH for all your hard-earned flown miles. If you fly TG alot, you can also transfer miles there, but it'd be fairly pointless given their exorbitant burn rate and minimal/nil mileage accrual on their lowest fare classes.

" Hi everyone, This is my first time here and I am also a newbie SQ Flyer and I apologize for asking some really silly questions here. I became a KrisFlyer member since April 2005 and haven't used it much since I do not travel that often unless my employer sends me overseas for some trainings or conferences. As of today, according to my last account statement, my current balance of KrisFlyer Miles is 10115 and Elite Miles is only 1100. The last time I flew and used my membership was in July last year for a short trip between CGK-SIN and SIN-CGK. This is how I earned my little Elite Miles above since I got 550 points from each leg. I will be attending an Australian conference this week and have a booking for CGK-SIN followed by SIN-SYD route. My question is, how many miles am I going to earn (roughly) from SIN-SYD (SQ220) route considering this is going to be like 6-7 hours flight or 6-7 times longer than a short CGK-SIN (SQ95X)which only lasts for 1 h 10 m.

Should I call them (this is four months down the road)? :S Btw, a very happy CNY if you happen to read this over the weekend Thanks EWR, I was actually in JNB itself on the date of your post, just got back to China today. Sorry I forgot to mention that I had waitlisted the flights just a week prior to departure.

Otherwise do call them up once more a week or so before your first sector. Jfyi, I returned on CX J on their 77W - very pleasant and comfortable flight - If there is any option for you to fly out of HKG and reedem Asia Miles - you may want to try this out as an alternative.

" Originally posted by zvezda View Post Switching from sectors and miles to revenue was a very good idea.... Yes and No. The other notable carrier to convert their program to a revenue based one was Air New Zealand. Their program issues airport dollars on the basis of 1NZ$ spent = 1 Airpoint $. Where NZ and SQ diverge however is the treatment of redemption of Airpoint $. Unlike SQ, NZ Airpoint $ redemptions are treated with parity to purchased tickets. Booking a seat with airpoint $ carries the same weight at booking one with real $. This means instant confirmation of selected seats for any NZ flight in any booking class on any sector. In comparison, Krisflyer redemptions are second class citizens which do the waitlist rumble... The other problem with switching from sectors and miles to revenue is the issue of transparency. Miles and sectors are easy for passengers to calculate. On the other hand PPSV is less transparent particularly where your ticket is purchased in another currency, or where your ticket is ROW or where your ticket is interline. For the later, SQ looks to its computer system to generate an accurate prorated PPSV based on the applicable interline agreement. Unfortunately this is not public information i.e. how much SQ pays the other carrier to transport you for the given sector(s) is confidential and so the customer is left to accept SQ's PPSV calculation. The lack of transparency opens the prospect of Club members being dissatisfied with PPSV calculations. This clearly works against the aim of fostering greater loyalty even whilst creating additional work and cost to the carrier to attend to increasing frequency of disputes on the issue. IMHO if reducing FFP / PPS Club costs was the aim of the exercise  then in the name of transparency and good corporate governance  SQ should have simply lifted the existing bar on PPS club requalification, perhaps to 50 sectors or 75k miles to throw out some arbitrary numbers. Existing privileges should not have been reduced. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.6402056217193604, 0.3597943186759949]",krisflyer

" Originally posted by SQ228 View Post What would SQ do though if you have a redemption flight and due to air traffic problems, you were delayed and missed it? I could always book the later flight I guess and give myself a 10 hour connection. Anything under 24 hours where I don't leave the airport is allowable without a visa provided I show them my onward connection. ? Are you referring to single ticket redemption or 2 separate tickets. Since you are on fairly linear route via PEK, I really encourage you to book a 6-segment RT ticket and don't complicate things. Whichever is allowed by the system will be fine even if the connection time is tight. Experience: I just missed a connection in Warsaw last week on a minimum 40 min connection. LOT to LOT award flight issued by SQ. They rebooked me on an alternative routing with no fuss with SAS. I saw my fellow passengers got offered an Air France routing even. If you miss such connection, they will find some way out. So even if you miss CA's flight to TSE, they will have to accommodate you on other airlines flights or put you in hotel room. Since it's unlikely they will put you 4 days later, they can put you on Air Astana or route via Urumqi, Seoul etc. They will have to. I have missed connections before too on redemption flights. Same case, no sweat, got rerouted, sometimes even on revenue fare class and I earned miles out of it! Just relax and reap the insurance benefits also if the delay is Long.

A number of my early MAN-SIN vv flights went via BRU. Having said that Schiphol is well connected by rail so it shouldn't take long to get there. Yeah, I remember taking 1 SIN-BRU direct before they took it off due to SARS. They still fly cargo there so there's a chance they'll be back, though I'm not holding my breath. Given how busy AMS is, I am probably going to route all my travel via FRA. With 2 flights a day, additional miles and access to the 77W planes - more than makes up for the difficulty of getting a seat on AMS and having to deal with a connecting flight. And I'm booking my x'mas flights home now because this waitlist business sux. I am on waitlist AMS-SIN, and SIN-FRA back. Grr. I'm not bothering to w/l SIN-AMS because with just 3 weeks it'd be impossible to clear.

" As far as I know, this type of early requalification still exists. In your example above, your account should be reset two months early - which is October 31st, 2008, which makes you have 14 months to requalify for the next year (your new PPS year still remains Jan 1 - Dec 31). However, in the next year, the reset will also be done only in October 31st, 2008, keeping the same PPS year (Jan 1 - Dec 31). PPS card validity is one month longer than the PPS year, according to the PPS section of SQ website.

My suggestions : First, in the beginning, perhaps a summary about our feelings (which then gets echoed in the body), something like: ""We are writing to you to express our anger and disappointment at the planned changes to the KrisFlyer program."" Second, in the first paragraph, change ""marginalize certain people"" to ""affect many of us deeply"", and ""is unfair"" to ""are unfair"". I suggest changing ""unreasonable and unmitigated disaster"" in Section 3 to: ""unreasonable reduction of redemption opportunities."" Finally, for the ending, perhaps we can suggest the implications for SQ: ""We have been loyal flyers for a long time, but these changes make us feel that such loyalty is not something that Singapore Airlines values. At best, this means we now have to consider earning miles with another frequent flyer program, instead of KrisFlyer. At worst, it will make us consider flying with your competitors when we travel long-haul. That makes us sad, because we have, over the years, grown to favor your product and services.

Customers may waitlist for a redemption flight up to three weeks before the flight departure date. However, please note that there may be instances on popular flights where waitlisting is not available. The status quo ante has certainly been upended, and I am not entirely happy with the changes (I think). I'll need to digest this and wait and see how it works in practice, but closing all waitlists three weeks prior to departure will (adversely) affect my booking practices!

" Looking back into the menus and wine lists I've saved (and some I've seen here on SQT), I believe SQ typically serves only one Bordeaux on a given flight, and it is often contrasted with a New World wine from the origin/destination country. For example, SQ would have the Cos or the Poyferre matched with Sequoia Grove Napa cab on California flights or a shiraz from Torbeck or Killikanoon on Australia flights. I think I've only seen one wine list from SQ sporting two Bordeaux (Cos and Pichon-Lalande, IIRC), and for some reason I think it was on a Japan flight (where Bordeaux are hugely popular). Perhaps others can provide more examples. As for whether SQ has permanently switch from Cos to Poyferre as the standard offering, I don't know but it would seem so. I haven't seen any SQ F wine lists on here with Cos in a while-- save for the A380 inaugural to SYD, which sported a 1982 Cos and another '82 Bordeaux, equally delicious. On my last SQ 001/002, they served Poyferre and it was very good. But I prefer Cos. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5639051198959351, 0.43609482049942017]",amenity_catering_lounges

While she was in ZRH, her company had her stay on in Europe for a business meeting, and as such they upgraded her E class ticket to Z class on CDG-SIN. If I understand correctly, the o/w fare difference between E and Z was paid via the Singapore travel agent. The r/t Z class fare is approx. S$8000, so one would reasonably expect her CDG-SIN to earn around $4000 PPSV.

" Thanks gookia2000 for your reply. I have completed my Europe trip, enjoy it very much. As I mentioned earlier, I gotten confirmation on CDG-SIN suites much earlier on. I was working hard on the SIN-FRA suites. Call up Krisflyer membership line. They told me (as pointed out by SQueeze) there are only 2 award seats for suites. The waitlist will not confirm unless someone cancel their confirmed award seats. And that also means someone else with higher priority didn't waitlist the same flight as you. Thus, I gave up SIN-FRA suites and confirm SIN-ZRH suites instead. Next time, really need to plan and book earlier. The first check-in was Ok. I arrived with a big limo cab/van. The ground air crew just stand in front of the door. No greeting. We just walk in to the first check-in ourselves alone, quietly. The check-in was done while seated, exclusively. The immigration was fast as it only serves the first/suites passengers. After check-in, ""Do you know where the TPR is?"" ""No"" ""It is just after immigration. Take the escalation up to 2nd level."" Wasn't the same as I read in the travel blog. You were not lead to the TPR. We were left to figure out how to reach there, though not too difficult. Too bad, I came with high expectation after reading some travel blog. The TPR is unique, exclusive but nothing to shout for. Just had a light meal as I know I will be given supper again as soon as I board the plane. The experience in the SIN-ZRH suites was much better. As there were only 4 passengers, we were given full attention. Air crews were always there within reach, smiling, offering help. We had the book-the-cook meal. The experience in the CDG-SIN suites was also good. But there were 7 passengers. The air crews were attentive, professional, friendly. No book-the-cook for Paris out-bound flight.

" http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-...ry_738004.html The Straits Times www.straitstimes.comPublished on Nov 25, 2011 The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals By Myra Martin As Singapore Airlines' (SIA) manager of Inflight Services, Mr Hermann Freidanck spearheads the creation of 1,450 different dishes every four months and hones the balance between advance cooking and reheating of meals on board an aeroplane, while also anticipating the drying effects of cabin air which affects people's taste buds. No stone is left unturned, right down to the compartmentalised aluminium foil packaging of each dish before it is presented to a passenger on board. In short, Mr Freidanck scrutinises all aspects of food and beverage served on board all of SIA's flights. Even if one passenger is allergic to aluminium foil, as he received an outstanding special request recently, he personally will ensure that a suitable alternative packaging is given instead. He has been doing this and more at SIA, for the last 13 years. What distinguishes this 58-year-old German is his knowledge, expertise, systematic delegation, foresight, gumption and a career in hotel management spanning two decades, most of which was spent in Asia. That background helps him ensure quality inflight meals that meet the expectations of SIA's clientele, usually comprising 60 per cent foreigners and 40 per cent locals - which makes for a broad spectrum of tastes. Mr Freidanck said that 'everyone is contentious when it comes to specific ideas of how certain dishes should taste' because essentially, as he quipped so succinctly, 'my grandmother does a better char kway teow than yours'. He oversees not just the overall production of meals in Singapore, but also the 53 other catering stations in destinations across 63 cities.

I presume the flyer just quoted a wrong SQ KrisFlyer number to the airline. Does anybody know what checking happens when a passenger quotes a number to a partner airline and before it is credited to an SQ account?

" Well overdue for an overhaul of all the Silverkris lounges at SIN. T2 also, not just T3. Food at F class is often not as good as the J class lounge, ironically, especially at non-peak times like midday. The food at the F class lounge just doesnt turn over quickly at those times, so its not as fresh. And there often more choice at the J class lounges. And TPR can be even worse. The food comes 2-3 minutes after ordering, so they are just microwaving food thats already been cooked. Thats a pretty low standard. Many other airlines have awesome F lounges with real dining experience, and for the TPR, that should be the reference point.

What I have found out is that when flying VA within Australia, you only earn elite miles if the VA flight you fly is an officially codeshared flight. It makes sense to me now why sometimes I get an elite miles credit and sometimes not. It stands to reason then that if the SQ flight is codeshared by VA, that the same agreement would most likely apply, provided that their partnership agreement is bilateral. SQ seem to reserve a certain quota of seats on their flights for VA, as last year when my brother wanted to fly his family to Japan on Xmas Eve, the only way they could source tickets on SQ228 out of MEL was to book it through VA.

" Thought you'd like to see this and your thoughts: Dear SIA, My name is X and I am Krisflyer number Y and I have been Elite Gold since 2011. I travel very frequently for work and have noticed in the last few years that Singapore Airs Krisflyer program is starting to lack severely in comparison to other frequent flyer programs and even other airlines in the Star Alliance program. Examples of these are: Miles expiring (I don't have this on other frequent flyer programs I am with) Not giving KFEG members priority boarding with business class passengers, which is the only airline to do this. Even with Star Alliance airlines I have never flown with I get more priority than with SQ. Not allowing KFEG members to check in at business class when we can with all other Star Alliance airlines except the one we are a member of. Having the system of saver, standard and full fare upgrades. SQ is the only airline I am aware of who has this system. You can now only upgrade from economy to premium economy if there is premium economy on that plane where as all other airlines offer business. No platinum tier: This is merely a suggestion, as other long haul airlines have it and it is something for a long haul airline that would be very welcome As you can see from my mileage credit I have been very loyal to SQ over the last few years but my usage has decreased as I don't feel I am being valued in comparison with other airlines and my business has altered because of this. SQ has a fantastic product which is why I am happy to pay higher fares in some cases. However for the increasingly restrictive benefits offered to me when I pay a premium to fly SQ it is no wonder why I have gone to other airlines in the last year. I look forward to your feedback. And the reply: Dear Mr X Thank you for your email dated 18 July 2016 to Singapore Airlines. We are most appreciative of the time you have taken to provide your feedback and would like to apologise for not being able to deliver a service that was up to your expectations. We value your comments and we are continuously reviewing and working on improving our KrisFlyer Membership Services to meet the expectations of our most valued customers such as your kind self. This is especially important in helping us to track our service standards and identify areas for improvement. Further to this, do allow us to explain that the difference between Saver and Standard on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir flights which redemption reservation is made available for our member to utilize their KrisFlyer miles: Saver award - These awards are offered in Economy, Business and First Class in most aircraft types. Saver awards require fewer KrisFlyer miles, ticket enabling members to fly for free sooner. The ticket validity is 12 months. Members have one free stopover per round trip redemption only. As saver awards are very popular, availability may be limited and some restrictions may apply. Standard award - These flight awards provide a greater selection of seats on all flights, ticket validity of 12 months, one free stopover for one-way redemption and two free stopovers per round-trip.

" Hi all , I have a booking from YYZ-JFK-SIN-MEL in J however , recently , I was told that I couldn't take this flight UNLESS an adult is accompanying me to the check-in counter. I'm a minor and they'll not accept me as a passenger even if my parents were to sign the UM Waiver in Singapore Office. I had asked for compensations and was given SQ21 (EWR-SIN) and YYZ-EWR however - it's not confirmed until she double-check with EWR to see if they allow me to check-in on my own and wait at the airport for e next connecting flight. YYZ-EWR is quite limited on * Booking but she's willing to open up full award for SQ21 in a separate booking (can't mix standard and saver on *A booking). Can you guys suggest what I should ask for - as in where to transit and which metal to take if the above SQ21 cant work out. (Or rather United States can't work). She found a YYZ-NRT-SIN-MEL however I citied the radiation in Japan and having taken AC1 flight before - I'm not happy w the service thus I do not wish to take that flight.

" Originally posted by SilverChris View Post SQ doesn't seem to be very generous when it comes to regional flight meals. TG beats SQ on the SIN-BKK flights. Completely agree. If flying economy, better off to fly TG than SQ on SIN-BKK route. Lower prices and better meals too! As a guide, TG offers a starter, 2 choices of main courses, dessert, warm roll and butter, bar cart service (2 rounds sometimes) with full selection of liquors/wines/beers/soft drinks etc, full cans of drinks always offered with top up of wines and bread rolls and rounding off with a coffee/tea service. On SQ, no starter is offered and the roll is cold and pre-packed. Also, no liquors are offered unless specifically requested. Only wines/juices/soft drinks/beer/coffee/tea on the meal cart.

" This is answered in the KF Programme Guide here.  Subject to individual airlines flight schedule changes.  You can make your booking only for round-trip travel on scheduled flights operated by Star Alliance carriers. All reservations must be confirmed before ticketing. Waitlisting is not permitted except on Singapore Airlines operated sectors only. If your itinerary includes bookings in different classes of service, the award level corresponding to the highest class will apply for the whole award ticket. Travel is subject to the blackout dates and capacity control of individual Star Alliance carriers.  Your Star Alliance Award itinerary can include a complimentary en route stopover in addition to the turnaround point. No stopovers are allowed for purely domestic travel or if your itinerary includes only European cities. You may not stopover in the country where you commenced your travel. For travel to or from Central America, no stopover is permitted in Continental USA. You are allowed a maximum of six travel segments in your itinerary.  You may include transits in your itinerary for flight connections. However, you cannot use your original departure point to transfer to a final destination on the return leg.  You can purchase additional stopovers for 10,000 KrisFlyer miles regardless of your class of travel.  For more flexible travel, you can include an open-jaw at either the origin or the destination (e.g. fly Singapore to San Francisco, then LA to Singapore, or fly Seoul to Singapore, then take a return leg to Tokyo). En route open-jaws are not permitted for Star Alliance Awards. Open-jaws are permitted across different award zones but the higher award level will apply.  Side trips are not permitted. A separate award ticket is required for a side trip.  Backtracking is not permitted. Travel must be made via the most direct route.  You can only make changes to the destination or carrier on an issued ticket if travel has not commenced. Such changes will require re-issuance of tickets at a service charge. Please refer to krisflyer.com for the relevant fee.  Itineraries must include at least one Star Alliance airline partner (excluding Singapore Airlines).

Personally , I would go for Monkfish. I find and feel that using cheese in the Lobster tends to over-power the natural taste of the lobster. The chinese style of cooking (spring onion and ginger) is more subtle and the flavours of the lobster enhanced. It's a matter of personal taste at the end of the day. Hope this helps.

KF doesn't get payments but also doesn't end up with corresponding liabilities. For those of us (like myself) who are mainly interested in redeeming on SQ, switching to another FFP doesn't work if - as shortfinals suggests - it will not be possible at all to redeem for 77W/380 flights with miles from other FFPs. 2 Cut up and return my PPS card and never take another SQ flight if I can help it. Painful though the announced changes may be, I don't think I'm at this stage and this is precisely what SQ are counting on. 3 Reduce the number of SQ flights taken. Like jjpb3 says, SQ serve a destination I go to frequently (SIN) but given that I also like HK very much, I suppose I could do an indirect routing in future with TAir. It would probably mean not requalifying for PPS and getting *G on some other FFP (e.g. BD); or, even ditching *A status altogether, given the withdrawal of UA LHR-JFK and that out of my 70+ sectors and 100,000+ BIS miles this year, the only *A flights have been SQ, UA to JFK and other *A airlines for my SQ PPS RTW run. 4 Moan (either here on SQT or to SQ) but ultimately take the pain with no change in my flying/FFP habits. SQ wins. Unfortunately, it looks like option 4 is the most likely at the moment... Number 3 is a real possibility for me. I mainly fly to HKG so changing to CX is a real choice.

" I am writing this from the new ICN SKL...waiting for SQ603. Originally posted by stargold View Post Just to bring to everyone's attention that the Silver Kris Lounge is now re-open in Concourse A at ICN. Only seen a handful of photos from a Korean forum, but looks to be fairly standard issue. No separate F section (makes sense with only 2x flights with F out of 7 per day). Has showers. I won't be in ICN for a while but if anyone is headed that way in the meantime, please visit and report Meanwhile, I suggest this thread is moved back into the current lounges thread so that people can add their photos/reports. stargold, it is standard issue...very much like the OZ and KE concourse lounges including all the concourse announcements... Originally posted by kapitan View Post Is there a smoking room in the lounge, there was one previously....... kapitan, sorry to be the bearer of bad news...there is no smoking room. Quick overview then...it has a *G sign outside, so should be open to pax on other *A carriers. As stargold mentioned, it has no separate F section. It is surprisingly roomy and airy compared to the OZ J/*G lounge, with apron views. Two thirds of the lounge are 'open roofed', with the remaining third tucked away and feeling a little more cozy...and closer to the restrooms and showers. Of everything there seems to be pairs: two unisex showers (sans toilets, spacious and light though), two gents sinks, two gents pissoirs, two gents toilets...a choice of two sandwiches, two buffet mains, two snacks, two WiFi access points...there is a choice of three cheeses and four beers though. No champagne, no cognac...but Bombay Sapphire is available. And lots more drinks to choose from. Chilean red and white wine, Cava, Campari, Bacardi, Absolut, and Chivas. Pepsi, not Coke. I personally prefer the catering and showers (avec toilets) in the KE lounge...the drink quality and food quality (catered by Hyatt Incheon) are just better. Drink selection is much smaller though. Reading material for English speakers is better at the SKL though... Makes a case for lounge hopping with PP. And dang, it's pretty fresh throughout ICN airport today...wish I didn't pack my jacket away in SHE. Update: just tried the showers...way better than the OZ or KE concourse ones. Makes the SKL my new favorite concourse lounge. Let's hope the catering gets improved a lil. And if the lounge feels cold, head to tucked away part. Much warmer in there. Update 2: the lounge is located on the KE lounge and transfer desk side...it's a slightly longer walk to the *A transfer desk and gates.

Thus you would not even know that this occured. Similar concept in internet banking where you are not allowed to delete the payee account for a fixed period of time after creation. Dear SuperJonJon, This is an interesting argument. However, the fraudster cannot do the last bit which is remove this nominee since his action of adding his name will be considered a change. Also, there is a difference in Krisflyer system to that of the banking industry. In the banking system, all you need to do is to change your internet banking/phone password and there will not be further damages done to your account. However, in Krisflyer system, the fraudster can still called up Krisflyer and continue to issue tickets for themselves since they are still an authorised nominee and you CANNOT change their authorisation status to NO or remove their name since you can only do this six months later. I believe in six months time, all the miles will disappear from your account. In short, you cannot do anything to stop the fraudster eventhough you discovered it from day one. Thank you.

" Hi all, I'm new to Singapore and wondering whether the AMEX rewards card's 5x points categories and selections work out to a better deal than the PremierMiles or KF AMEX cards? From the reading here, it's 1.6 KF miles for every S$1, whereas from my calculations it's 3.125 KF miles for every S$1 (5 MR pts for every S$1, 1000 KF for 1600 MR pts). Since you can choose 5 categories to earn on, I'm tempted to push most of my spend to this card if my math is right. The kicker for me is the top-up. According to the site: ""IF I DONT HAVE QUITE ENOUGH POINTS FOR A REWARD, IS IT POSSIBLE TO BUY THEM? Yes. You can top up your points at just S$30 for 1,000 Membership Rewards points. Each purchase top-up has to accompanied by a reward redemption. Terms and conditions apply."" So by my reckoning, you can purchase pts at 33.3... to S$1. I'm really curious to see what those terms are and if they keep that up for long. Anyone else come to this conclusion? Cheers!

Dubai isn't that expensive... especially compared to Europe... taxis are still pretty cheap - it costs me about 30DHS to get from Emirates Towers (Sheikh Zayed Rd) to the airport... or maybe 50 each way to get to the Dubai creek/souk. also food can be found cheap... you can pick up a shawarma (like a kebab... why can't i find those in singapore?!) for about DHS10, or even less if you're lucky... The biggest problem can be finding a taxi in dubai... if its busy they never stop unless you're white & giong to jumeriah...sometimes its taken me 2 hours to get a cab! a good tip is to walk into a nice hotel via side entrance... walk out thru the main entrance & pretend you're staying there & need to get to the airport, the porters will hail a cab for you & sort you out. also taxis are more likely to stop at hotels. its not really a place you can walk from area to area easily (distances are pretty big) and the buses are just crap... i wouldn't recommend them, even for a student however there is a hop-on hop off bus which goes to all the major sites... just be careful as some buses aren't airconditioned (then you'll definately need that shower!) where the costs come in is if you're eating in the top hotels, sleeping in the top hotels, or going out to the clubs etc... however for a day trip you can do it reletively inexpensively.

That's a good tip - thanks taipeiflyer. I'll make sure to pay with as much voucher value as possible then, to reduce KF miles loss. Off-topic : incidentally, did you know that the nett price after 10% PPS discount is ROUNDED DOWN after every purchase ? I found this out last year when I bought a $15 item, and the price was rounded down to $13 after the discount. I then bought another one for $13 again, paying $26 total for the two. However, if I'd bought 2 at the same time, I would've paid 10% off $30 = $27. Strange but true fact........ (For those of you who don't know what we're talking about, Krishop gives 10% discount off all purchases to PPS members - so do ask a PPS member you know for a favor when you want to buy something.)

" Originally posted by chisquared View Post Personally, I don't see the issue with auctioning off seats in the PEY cabin. There's nothing inherently 'cheap' about having to bid for something. Otherwise, Sotheby's has been getting things wrong for *centuries*. If you don't like the idea of having to bid for a PEY seat, then don't bid. There are people who don't feel the same way, and if they're willing to pay more than SQ is willing to give them a PEY seat for, then it seems a bit bizarre to not let that mutually beneficial exchange happen. If the argument is that SQ should just post a fixed price for the upgrade instead, the issue there is that an auction tends to have better revenue-maximising properties than posted-price mechanisms. I can't then begrudge SQ too much for going down the auction route. Here's my personal perspective, my background being in Marketing and Public Relations. Why this is a bad idea from a Marketing perspective stems from two issues- how pricing mechanisms affects branding, and consistency. On the first point, the broadest example is Product Bundling. On full service carriers like SQ, the product is bundled. Low cost carries are typically unbundled i.e. on AirAsia you can buy a ticket, with the meal, and baggage separately. Why wouldnt SQ adopt the latter? One big reason for that is branding. Im sure you can see that. Similarly, other pricing and promotion mechanisms including bidding, lucky draws, and scratch cards are not suited for every brand. They each have their pros and cons and they may or may not be suitable based on a brands positioning. Let me provide an example. Im not sure where you are from but if you have been to a casual-dining Japanese restaurant in Singapore like Ichiban Boshi, they often have spin-the-wheel type draws where you win discount cards for your next visit. Now can you imagine a Michelin Star restaurant doing the same? It would be almost demeaning. This is different from an expensive art auction which is done in a bidding style because the nature of the product sold is that its value is not fixed and determined by the perception of potential buyers. Which brings me to the second point, consistency. SQ is selling seats. Their various seats in the cabin are identical (negating individual preferences e.g. for aisle seats). And SQ prides itself on the consistency of its service. A bidding system takes away that consistency. And why dont customers who dont like it simply not partake in the bid like you suggest? Youre forgetting one important point, a lack of information at the time of purchase and dissonance (buying something and regretting after). For example, a customer who isnt an avid traveller might have spent $1,000 on an Economy ticket to Narita. He then gets this email from SQ to bid for an upgrade. He bids $300, paying a total of $1,300 for a Premium Economy ticket. He wins the bid. A few hours later he visits SQs website and realises they are selling PEY tickets for the sector at $1,200. He would not be happy, even though he voluntarily forked out the $300. He might write in to Krisflyer and demand to get $100 back citing that he wasnt aware of how much the PEY ticket was sold for. Sure SQ has maximised revenue but the customer feels hes been ripped off, and this is a customer who was initially happy with his $1,000 Economy ticket, is now unhappy with what he sees as a vague upgrade mechanism. The consistency of the brand experience is taken away. I agree 100%. Hence, my mail to the Management reads: I wrote in too. I love SQ that much that I'd alert them to what I see as a terrible Marketing blunder even though I don't work for them...

" Mileage Deals Spur Runs for Elite Status http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1239...moj_industries Mileage Deals Spur Runs for Elite Status If you ever wanted elite status on an airline, now's your chance. And if you're worried about losing your top-tier status because you've reduced business travel, there's a clever way to keep all those perks -- provided you've got some time to fly. The plunge in business travel has triggered a wealth of special frequent-flier program deals, from triple mileage on some routes to double elite-qualifying miles on all travel and huge bonuses for international trips. Play the promotions right and one trip can get you enough miles for a free domestic coach ticket plus elite status for a year. There's simply no better perk in commercial air travel today than having top-tier status with a major carrier. Elite-level travelers enjoy free upgrades; premium seating; no baggage fees; special check-in, security and boarding lines; early boarding privileges; and priority on standby lists. And elite fliers aren't the only ones who gain from these deals. Consumers who have seen the value of their miles decline as airlines raised the price of awards are regaining some buying power -- at least for the moment. Airlines say they are making more seats available for award redemptions, and some travel awards have even been put on sale. For example, tickets to Europe regularly priced at 55,000 miles were recently offered by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines for 40,000 miles. ""I can't remember a time like this,"" said Randy Petersen, president of Frequent Flyer Services, a Colorado Springs, Colo., publisher. ""Right now is one of the richest periods I've ever seen in 23 years of following these programs."" The promotions, most of which run until June 15, are so tempting and the fares are so cheap that some travelers are making ""mileage runs"" just to qualify and fill their mileage accounts. Jeff Schley found a way to vault to United's elite 1K status -- which requires that travelers log 100,000 miles annually -- with just one week of flying across the globe. Mr. Schley moved to Saudi Arabia last year to teach at an American school and did not have elite flier status. He left the Middle East on April 2 and flew to Washington, D.C., then on to Los Angeles, Sydney, San Francisco, Sydney, Los Angeles, Boston, Los Angeles, Washington and finally, back to Saudi Arabia. Over seven days, he spent 98 hours aboard airplanes, flying 52,000 miles. With United's double elite-qualifying miles offer, that earned him 1K status. Cost: $2,900. Rarely having to fly coach again: Priceless. ""Living overseas, travel is really a chore if you don't have status,"" said Mr. Schley. Since he'll earn bonus miles as an elite flier and his mileage run yielded an additional six coupons for an automatic upgrade good on any long-haul flight, Mr. Schley figures he'll be able to re-qualify easily and will be able to upgrade on most any flight in the future while he lives abroad. The flying itself -- entirely in coach -- was tedious. He wore compression socks to minimize the risk of blood clots forming in his legs, and used an eye shade, travel pillow and noise-canceling headset. An Australian customs agent who saw him entering the country twice in a few days quizzed him carefully on why he was staying only seven hours each time. And he grew tired of watching ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""Marley & Me"" over and over. ""I never would have done this without the double elite qualifying miles,"" he said. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines triggered the war over elite-qualifying miles in March, when it launched a double elite-qualifying-miles offer. Most U.S. airlines quickly matched the bonus. Elite-qualifying miles, or EQMs in the parlance of road warriors, are different from regular frequent-flier miles, which can be earned any number of ways, from credit-card purchases to restaurant dining as well as travel. EQMs are earned mostly by air travel alone, and are used by airlines to determine who gets granted special status in frequent-flier programs. Typically you need 25,000 EQMs each year for the lowest level of status, which grants a traveler early boarding and special security lines and possible upgrades. Usually 100,000 EQMs qualify travelers for top-tier status and better perks. Airlines say the bonus offers are designed to keep customers from switching to discount airlines during the recession. In past downturns, higher-fare carriers have lost market share to low-cost carriers. ""We don't want our best customers right now choosing another airline,"" said Jeff Robertson, Delta Air Lines' vice president of loyalty programs. The EQM bonuses have proven very popular. While American declined to discuss its elite-miles promotion, United says more than 50% of its elite-level frequent fliers have signed up for its mileage offer; Delta says one-third of its elite members have registered for its bonus promotion. Both airlines say customers are worried about re-qualifying since corporations have aggressively cut back on travel. Indeed, despite the offers, United projects it will have fewer elite-level members next year because of corporate travel cutbacks. ""This will certainly counteract some of the natural decline we're seeing, but it's not going to fully account for it,"" said Graham Atkinson, president of United's Mileage Plus frequent-flier program. Both Delta and United have put some frequent-flier awards on sale and seen consumers, anxious to use miles to travel these days instead of cash, snap them up. United saw a 40% increase in redemption activity when it cut the price of its trans-Atlantic ""saver"" award, the lowest-priced coach offering, Mr. Atkinson says. When Delta cut the price in miles on some of its frequent-flier awards, redemption activity jumped 25% the first day the new rates were loaded into computer systems -- before they were even advertised. Mr. Robertson said Delta plans big incentives on its credit-card deal with American Express Co. to help convince customers of Northwest, which Delta acquired, to switch credit cards. And airlines say more specials are likely on specific routes because of intense competition or just slow bookings, particularly when summer buying slows down. Smart mileage-runners take advantage of special situations. Fares to Australia, for example, are particularly cheap right now because incumbent airlines are battling a new start-up, V Australia, part of the Virgin Blue Group Ltd. Likewise, when JetBlue Airways Corp. began flying nonstop from Boston to Los Angeles, rivals struck back with a triple-mileage offer on the same route. Mr. Schley took advantage of both. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines offered tickets to Europe for 40,000 miles. For a one-day run, the cheap prices and triple-mile offer of the Boston-Los Angeles route is hard to beat. For $250 or so round-trip, you can earn more than 15,000 miles and more than 10,000 elite-qualifying miles. That can be a big boost to someone looking to top up a mileage account for award tickets or worried about re-qualifying for elite status. That's exactly what spurred Douglas Hardy of Detroit to buy a ticket to Singapore, with only enough time there for him to shower. Mr. Hardy, chairman of a real-estate company, isn't traveling for business as much as he used to, so he's worried about losing his Platinum Elite status on Northwest Airlines Corp., which has gotten him upgraded to first class on every flight he has been on since he reached the platinum level. ""I like the perks Platinum offers -- there's real value to it. But this year I'll be significantly short,"" he said. To avoid losing all that, Mr. Hardy paid $1,800 for a round-trip ticket from Detroit to Tokyo and on to Singapore in a couple of weeks. He'll spend less than five hours on the ground in Singapore. Mr. Hardy bought a coach ticket that he was able to upgrade using certificates he earned from Northwest, and flying in first class means he'll get triple elite-qualifying miles. For nearly 40 hours of flying in three days, he'll travel 19,436 miles. The triple elite-qualifying miles offer will give him more than 58,000 miles toward Northwest's platinum threshold of 75,000 EQMs. With other business and pleasure trips, he expects to re-qualify for platinum status through March 2011. ""I'm looking forward to it,"" he said. ""I think it'll be fun."" ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.6913265585899353, 0.3086734116077423]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Upon contented with the fact that no miracle whatsoever can bring me back to Malaysia for Hari Raya, I searched through the KrisFlyer website and stumbled into this question, which exactly reflected my situation, in the FAQs section. Basically it says I have to ring the KrisFlyer Membership Services and they'll charge a Service Fee of 5,000 KrisFlyer miles or USD 50 for the cancellation and re-deposition of the miles back into my account. So on 21 September 2009, merely a little out of 24 hours before the scheduled departure time of flight SQ 107 on 22 September 2009, the first of 4 which I had in my itinerary, I rang the KrisFlyer Membership Services office in Singapore at +65 6789 8111 and was answered right away, after going through the auto-answering system. I was assisted by a very pleasant and wonderfully helpful KrisFlyer female agent, whom after I described my problem in details to her, informed me that the correct way to do is by cancelling the booking through the website, just like the cancellation of any other normal (non-redemption) flights, which I already familiar with (despite the FAQs page said otherwise). As for the charges of either 5,000 KrisFlyer miles or USD 50, I told her that I would prefer to pay rather than loosing 5,000 KrisFlyer miles (because it is equivalent to, more or so, flying on 1 direct KUL-IST flight), to which she pointed out to me that I will be given an option on whether to pay via miles or cash when I undergo the process soon. A definite plus point to her was that before ending the conversation, she strongly advised me to do the online cancellation pronto because at that time, I was like 15 minutes away from 10:25 on 21 September 2009 - 24 hours away from my scheduled departure time, to which then I am subjected to another Cancellation Fee of 7,500 miles of USD 75 in addition of the Service Fee (as mentioned before) for doing the cancellation in less than 24 hours prior to the scheduled departure time. This very fact is also mentioned in the FAQs page quoted above. I was very impressed with her! After a big thank to her and ended the phone call, I logged-in into the KrisFlyer website and cancelled the booking right away. After a click on 'Cancel This Booking' on the left bar, I was directed to a page on whether to pay the Service Fee using miles or cash, to which I choose cash as planned earlier, but I forgot to print screen this page. Another click away and it was done. All in painlessly less than 1 minute. It's incredible! And I was issued out with the confirmation right away. What SQ did was, from MYR 439.00 that I paid earlier during the redemption process, they took MYR 106.00 as a Service Fee (which strangely does not equivalent to USD 50, I am still puzzled on what is the actual Service Fee charges amount  USD 30?) and they refunded me MYR 333.00 back into my credit card and 11,250 miles back into my KrisFlyer account. So in the end, after the whole fiasco, I just lost MYR 106.00 as a Service Fee, which is great! (And probably another SAR 14.00 for the phone call to Singapore, but it is almost immaterial to mention). My KrisFler miles tally is back to 11,514 and it shows right away in the main page! FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION An important point to note from the refund policy of SQ against the other Malaysian airlines is that, based on my experience, SQ refunded everything  the airport taxes and all other applicable surcharges, something that AirAsia didn't when they refunded me my 7 tickets. So a big 2 thumbs up to SQ! This magnificent online functions for managing booking and miles redemption with prompt, flawless and credible refund policy alone is an extremely strong selling point for SQ that can simply, honestly, win over a traveler like me in a snap. I am still stunned with the fact that SQ excels this good, with regards to this whole subject. If you are familiar with the incredibly much painful procedures of the same while dealing with MH [you know the I-can't-do-anything-although-the-multi-million-dollar-computer-system-is-in-front-of-my-face-you-have to-call-the-hotline-for-everything-and-it-will-take-at-least-15-minutes-of-waiting-on-the-phone-before-someone-pick-up-the-phone-and-in-the-end-they-still-can't-solve-your-problem thingy] or the fuss of getting the attention of AirAsia's top honchos to get things done no matter how petty it was after lurking around their Facebook profiles, then you would possibly appreciate the weight of that statement of mine, much much more.

" I noticed reading through the old FAQ of the other forum that during the days when attaining PPS was done through the sector calculation that there was an unpublished benefit that allows you to re-qualify early should you receive the required amount of sectors 9 months from where your re-qualifying period and this would give you 15 months to requalify again. Thus I have several questions: 1) Does this early re-qualifying thing still exist or did exist under the PPSV scheme? 2) If yes to question 1, I would like to ask the following: If say my re-qualification period for QPP02 was January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 and I received the $25K before October 1, 2008 and hence my re-qualification for QPP03 would be between September 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009 giving me the 15 months to re-qualify. Now say between October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2009 I got $25K by flying more SQ flights meaning I did it in 9 months, does this mean I have re-qualified early at July 1, 2009 and my re-qualification period for QPP04 would be July 1, 2009 to Sep 30, 2009? Or is that I have to get the $25K during nine-month re-qualification between January 1, 2009 and September 30, 2009 to be re-qualified early for QPP04? Oh another question, not about re-qualification but becoming PPS for the first time. If I were to collect $25K three months after my first eligible flight for PPSV, do I have to wait nine months later to be admitted into QPP01 or would SQ give me QPP01 as soon as they see I have $25K and hence I do not have to wait for another 9 months. I’m trying to learn much about the PPS system so I can consider whether or not it is worthy for me to fly SQ on a regular basis or not. Thanks for your help!

I know of some UA folks scoring 2-3 F seats in a go on one flight and booking trips worth a total of like 1.5 to 2MM UA MP miles (nice to have that many ). Given that SQ does not allow any holds they kicked themselves here and most of those tickets were issued right away. Autsch .. and of course not that great for the rest of us as it could mean that SQ F availability could again become a scarce commodity. SQ is not the victim here, it's Krisflyers like you and I: SQ had earmarked the seats for redemption bookings anyway - just not planned to release them to partners. What's the consequence? The seats are gone and now not available to Krisflyers. Whatever flights I looked up last night, often even 'standard' was only available on waitlist. SQ is getting good money for those seats from its partners and as the seats were not planned to be sold, this will do the P&L good - maybe the move wasn't that unintentional after all?

So can we use BTC but then deside to have a meal on the normal menu? When do they serve dinner can we decide what time or is it set? CAn we have as many drinks as we like. If so does this include Champain and beer ect Do we have to wait for them to bring drinks or can we ask for drinks when we want? What about nibbles if we are hungry between meals?

" Originally posted by LionCity View Post Yes, it is disheartening to see SQ acting in a way to take away the little things that makes PPS different. The next question on my mind is to weight the differences between PPS and the Gold Card and the tier membership of One World in consideration of SQ's higher fares. Load factors are high despite higher fare (albeit fuel costs have advanced) and probably Management felt that PPS is less important now unlike in the past used as a tool to advance Premium Class Travel with SQ. Seems like you may be right. They are focusing much more on 'right now'. I am guessing that they are so confident that they will continue to be the best in the air that they don't need to woo us much (if any) for loyalty. We will just return for the good products. For the long haul products, yes maybe - but others are catching up! Look at BA's NCW, CX's new First... they are not that far behind SQ's. For regional products, SQ's marginally better products can usually be way too much premium over the competitions. But then again, yes I am probably not their desired target market whose employer/company will pay any price to get on the plane in J/F to go somewhere. I have been trying to make sense of the cutbacks of the PPS Club. I have made myself understand some of them (crowded lounges, etc.), but things like these... I am really at loss of what to think. It is like a game of 'how far can we go to reduce perks & glams and still let them s*ck it up'. As to comparing to other OneWorld Gold memberships - I am pretty sure that the other program shows more appreciation of our business.

Of course with 106.75, my QPP02 is already guaranteed even though my requalification period is not due till Jan 2007.

" Originally posted by antepali View Post Hello. I will be traveling over the next few weeks from JFK-SYD via SIN and return. I have booked my tix using the First Saver redemption option. My question is as follows: will I be granted access to all SQ F lounges? Will I be able to use the VS Clubhouse at JFK? I am unsure since I am on a KF redemption tix and do not know the policy. Any assistance would be appreciated! Regards- KB First of all, Welcome To SQTalk! That should be such a long journey. Presumably it is no stop over in between. But since you are in F, you should be well rested. At JFK, F pax on SQ25 will be invited to use VS Clubhouse. I like this lounge. Fun and funky. And yes, love my time waiting there. If you are interested, you can check the previous menus for SQ25. Arriving in FRA, depending on that day, whether SQ25 gets a gate, or has to park in remote, all pax must disembarks. You can ask the ground staff where you can go for shower or which lounge to go to. As I recalled in May, it was UA RCC, but I decided to go to LH SEN Lounge instead. SQ25 usually arrives in T3 at Changi,a nd your flight to SYD will depart from T3 as well. SKL T3 First Class Lounge would be the choice. Since it's a redemption F seat you have, at the moment, the policy doesn't entitle you to enter The Private Room. If you have a long layover at Changi or have a stopover in Singapore, you can use The First Class Check-In Lounge which will let you to go through special immigration area and you will be in the departure secure area in a matter of minutes. In SYD, SQ has its own SKL FCL, but some of us here like the Air New Zealand Lounge instead. Of course by now you know where to go at Changi. It's before midnight flight for SQ26. So the lounge is busier than usual. Arrival of SQ26 in FRA is very early morning. Usually it will be at Gate C8 or somewhere near that. The lounge nearby would be UA RCC/IFL. I usually opt for shower here. Yes, the H2O amenity kits provided in the shower room is a pretty good for me. The shower will make me refresh for the morning day flight back to JFK. Hope this is helpful. Have great flights aboard Singapore Airlines. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.8256028294563293, 0.17439718544483185]",amenity_catering_lounges

 They are going bonkers over here. not sure what got to their heads. Only Unrestricted awards (now Standard) for the new seats were bad enough in the past but now they bring Full awards on top of that to laugh at us? Haha and we were bitching about LH introducing the HON / SEN awards at now reduced 150% miles (where a normal award equals 100% so a 50% premium). LH looking modest these days. I will be even more fierce now to get the SQ check in agents to remove that SQ KF number from my BP that they automatically insert into all my PNR's even if my TA only booked the flights with my BD DC number. Somehow the SQ res system (?) just overwrites the BD number with my SQ KF number (do they match pax data to KF profiles?). Anyone has any similar experiences with that? Checkmytrip shows BD DC number and at check in I present only my BD Gold card but I get my BP and it has only my SQ KF number on it and not even BD *G.

" I had this issue recently with the call center. I had to get a approval for them to charge the zone X to zone X F saver rate for the entire journey, they wanted to redeem each leg separately (J saver + F saver). They insisted it was a recent change in policy but on the bottom of the current award chart it still says - General Notes: • Singapore Airlines Suites and First Class are only available on selected Singapore Airlines flights. SilkAir does not have a Suites/First Class cabin. Business Class seats will be allocated to members who redeem their miles for Singapore Airlines Suites and/or First Class on Singapore Airlines flights which do not have a Singapore Airlines Suites/First Class cabin. The number of miles required for the entire trip may be determined at the redemption level of the highest class of service flown. Please check the classes available on the flight before making a redemption. You might have to be insistent with them saying it is still currently noted on the award chart you should be charged for a F saver for the entire journey, If it is indeed a change in policy it seem ridiculous they you have to use more miles for a mixed class redemption over a First award. So going off the award chart you are going from zone 9 to zone 2 which is 75,000 miles each way less the 15% discount. http://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pd...wardCharts.pdf ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.5091189742088318, 0.4908810555934906]",krisflyer

I love the Bak Kut Teh and hazelnut veal; they're my go-tos on the BTC menu and more often than not I BTC so that I know my main course will at least be edible, but enjoy starting the meal with caviar even more. That said I believe there are instances when a BTC order will eliminate the offering of caviar (and indeed most other items on the regular menu). I remember BTC'ing a Japanese box meal (it had a Japanese name starting with K...) on a SIN-MEL, which turned out to be way more comprehensive than your standard main course - it was a complete meal in itself with starters and sweets, and as I was the only passenger in First they didn't load any other foods on to the plane except the bread plate. There was literally nothing else, not even cheese. It was disappointing as I had planned on some caviar for brunch and always end the meal with cheese and port. I understand why they wouldn't bother loading any other items in that scenario but had I known I'd have ordered a more 'standard' BTC meal.

" Hi guys, I'm in a bit of a dilemma/limbo currently. Here are the facts, fyi: 1. I registered as a KF member back in 2002/2003 but had never really been able to chalk up on miles since I predominantly flew Q and was thus not eligible for mileage accrual. 2. I've started flying more this year and am currently ES. Here is my statement... Current Teir: Elite Silver Valid Until: 31 August 2009 KF Current Balance: 41,234 Current Elite Miles: 0 I must have started out before Jan 08 with like 5000 miles, but over the course of the months been doing a couple of SIN-SFO rounds, thus enabling me to hit the current 40k that i have. A. Question/or predicament is, pretty much like what i've read, will i be eligible for EG when i do my next SFO-SIN mid September (approx. 9k miles), bringing me past the 50k-point? I'm inclined to think since i am an existing/old member, i will need another 50K elite miles (of which i currently have none!)... B. Wondering if i'll be able to appeal to SQ for a show of some good ol' SQ love so that I will be able to attain EG by the end of my next SFO-SIN in Sept (or at least when I do SIN-SFO-SIN again later in October) since all but the initial 5k miles would have been earned through this year (since Jan 08)? Thanks for all your feedback on this thread. i've been following it and have found it very valuable. I find myself currently in a similar position as INIX in that perhaps I shoulve just discarded my old account, gotten myself a new one and achieve EG without the extra 25k elite miles i now require...

" Taipeiflyer: First off, why would anyone paid F class on UA out of their own pocket? I live in Bay Area so for me to fly SFO – Asia. I do a lot of business in Hsinchu so I fly quite a bit to TPE so I will use the mileage calculation from SFO – TPE. From SFO – TPE on C-class using UA, I paid $0.00 because my company paid for it. I get 8068 miles including fare bonus. I also get 8068 bonus miles for UA 1K member. Base on that mileage alone, I can get 1 F class in 8 round trips. According to your calculation, your round trip is 11,879 miles. So you need 120K for 1 F class. Your best case is 110,500 with 15% discount. You'll need 11 round trips @ $4117.20 = $45.289K. The most my company ever paid for my C-Class tix is 3500USD. So I need 8 round trips @ 3500USD = 28.0K USD. Any question? BTW, I remember that if you use Singapore Airlines Mileage to travel from US west coast to SE Asia. I would need to have 180K miles. But UA is only 120K. Any more question?

It seems Continental and BMI also have a tendency to status match. The primary reason for looking for the status match now is to get Gold in time for my longhaul flights to the US in Jan, if for no other reason than lounge access and (one could hope) upgrades - but I want to keep earning Elite Miles with Singapore so I get the local benefits.

" The beverage selection is to the left of the pizza station, which also comes with Turkish tea and tea cups. Meanwhile, a manned bar is available nearby. The selection isn't particularly impressive, and the protruding wires of the TV really ruin the vibe. For last-minute business needs, a business centre is located to the left near the bathrooms. I stepped off a dreadful redeye which was TG-ed to a 773, and I was really looking forward to freshening up. Thankfully, this lounge does have a shower room that's located within the men's room. I can only assume the ladies' has one too. Amenities are by Euphoria Collection, though I can't say I've heard of this brand before this. They didn't include shower gel, which would be an issue as I'll explain in a bit. The shower itself is a straightforward experience. No fancy showerheads that spray from three different directions, just a run-of-the-mill shower with an external water heater. As far as *A showers go in BKK, this is probably the worst despite being the newest. The shower room is on the small side, there's no attached toilet (SKL Changi style), there wasn't any shower gel available as the dispensers were empty, the ceiling is quite low which might be a problem if you're above 6ft, the shower screen doesn't close properly making floods inevitable, and the only place to open your carry-on is on the floor. On the way out, I spotted a quiet area which might be useful for those trying to get some shut eye in between flights. It might not be a flat surface that the TG lounge offers, but it's certainly much quieter and darker. Overall, this lounge is a nice addition to the *A family in BKK. It's quiet in the day as the TK flights only depart in the evening, and might make for a more peaceful experience compared to the TG/SQ/BR lounges. Catering isn't its strong suit, and you'd be much better off taking a shower elsewhere, but for those seeking a quiet place to relax in for an hour or so, this place is a worth a visit.

When you hit 25K or slightly above, you achieved KF Silver in May thus the counter has reset. You have flown 1,936 miles since achieving Silver and would require another 23,064 miles to get Gold.

" You know ever since the official announcement of the $25K SGD shocker, I have really been thinking alot about all possible motives for SQ to really go through with this bold move. Yes many of us including myself are crying foul. However IMO as SQ themselves have built a well-renowed brand name of their own for many decades, they may somehow believe that transforming an already exclusive PPS program into a much deeper exclusive level is not going to drift too much customer away. There are many travelers out there who can care less about frequent flyer/loyalty programs and mainly focus on what the airline offers. In the case with SQ pax, many of them loves the brand so much that they would not even give a damm if the carrier's FF/Status programmes are at the opposite end of the spectrum: ""I love SQ's onboard product and service so much....who cares if Krisflyer & PPS are nothing but two programs of worthless crap. As long as they get the job done on the flight where it really matters the most, I am happy"". I know some may disagree; however, it is this well-know brand recognition in the aviation and service industry to my belief that this maybe one of the elements that drove SQ management into this bold move.

" Originally posted by SQ228 View Post What I can't get my head around is why SQ offers a ""Seafood only"" meal but no ""Seafood free"" meal. Many people do not like seafood and fish and some are also anaphylatic to many forms of seafood. (But then SQ's love of tossing around peanuts only 20 min into a long haul flight suggests they have little concern about anaphylaxis! But maybe the number of compulsory anaphylaxis training sessions work forces me to sit through has left me bitter and twisted ) So very often, one of the two meal options in Y is a fish offering. And on many such occasions, the last section of the plane to be served gets all the fish that the rest of the cabin didn't want, which leads me also to wonder why they get the balance of the two options so wrong, unless the catering companies operate on a '50/50 only' basis. I'm not a vegetarian and I eat practically everything but NOT fish and seafood. I know many other who are the same. I've been relegated to the fish option enough times to make me contemplate ordering vegetarian, but even though I love vegetables and am quite partial to tofu, I really don't want to potentially consign myself to tofu when so many of the SQ Y meals really are excellent for economy plane food. Is it acceptable passenger etiquette to catch a passing flight crew member after menu distribution and let them know in advance that you can't eat the fish option? I know I could just demand, but I respect the tough job FAs have making everyone happy and try to be a pleasant passenger. SQ228, for normal meals, SQ usually serves one non-seafood mains option, no? The seafood is usually in the appetizer e.g. smoke salmon. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5381917953491211, 0.4618081748485565]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Originally posted by KeithMEL View Post You don't actually need to accrue any miles to KF, just allow them to 'track' your PPS Value from your flying on SQ. All your miles go to your other FFP, and they'd also count towards status on the other FFP. No complaints about LH SEN status, got seats beside me blocked in economy (flights weren't full obviously), SEN line is v efficient (especially the one in Switzerland), get bday cards from both LH SYD and their German office, and once I got invited to a function they had in MEL. My only complaint about M+M earn/burn wise is their inflexibility with redemption routings as I've mentioned in post 2 of this thread. But as you're based in a large *A hub this won't be much of a problem for you. BMI dc is obviously currently the best with earn/burn and it's certainly been a joy to be able to redeem so many good value awards, though dealing with Pune of late has been frustrating to say the least. However I wouldn't recommend them to anyone starting out due to the inherent uncertainties involved with the LH takeover. You might also wish to check out TK Miles & Smiles. It's meant to be good for status, even more so if you live outside of Turkey. I've not looked at the earn/burn though. For anything else I'd have to defer to the real *A experts. Hiya Yeah I did look into the double dipping thing so I am quite happy with that, even though this PPS devaluation thing is quite something. I have brought up the issue of miscalculations of PPSV on RTW fares and they found a nice solution for me. I am starting to veer towards M&M, esp after reading about your perks! ( I do love birthday cards and free food! haa) And frankly you gotta give it to the Germans for efficiency. Their burn chart from SIN is so similar to SQ. In fact if not for SQ's 15% online discount, ULH awards with LH is cheaper by a few thousand miles. I did research TK, and looked at the burn chart. For a business class RT flight SIN - USA, they are 20,000 miles more than LH. The qualification and re-qualification is amazing though on TK. From the little I have read on their customer service etc though, it is a nightmare. Thanks very much though for saying you would not recommend BD right now. I think that is what I needed. So many say just stick to it and get transfered across when it is time. But you are right that there are so many uncertainties. Thanks again Keith, much appreciated...

You can purchase the top-up miles while you are making your online redemption booking. The purchase is effected immediately if the transaction is done online.

I'm sure I was previously told that if you need to purchase extra miles, you cannot get the 15% discount. The question relates to getting upgrades, not reward tickets. TIA for any info. Yes, you need only 50% of the miles required then you are entitled to top up miles for an award flight. If you are doing an upgrade (Economy to J or J to F), when topping up the miles, there will be no 15% discount.

I can do without the lifestyle perks which looks useless to me anyway,the PPS Club Reserve programs require exorbitant amount of miles and I can't spare the time to participate sometimes. I have been researching sometimes an alternative carrier which provides better value within SEA but sadly most carriers in our region do not offer the connections that I need or I can't see the value of trading off an extra 3 hours Travelling time va a direct SQ route to save a thousand dollars and here I am,stuck with SQ. The only time that I genuinely felt happy and appreciated the existence of SQ is when you have an extraordinary set of Crew that really makes you feel like home The moment you sit down till you disembark. It is the crew members that make me see the value of sticking with SQ and not the useless PPS program ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5981905460357666, 0.4018094837665558]",amenity_catering_lounges

" The savings of SGD 15-20 Millions worked out to 1.5% to 2% out of a profit of 1 Billion dollars. If 50% of the Members equates to about 22,500 members (assuming 45,000 PPS Members as quote by Peasant). Considering that 20% of the fare of these 22,500 members are lost, it will equate to 4,500 members not flying with SQ because of these changes. Assuming a revenue of $12,500 per passenger, it will a revenue loss of SGD 56,250,000 or SGD 56.25 Million. Based on marginal cost analysis (as most fixed cost and semi-fixed cost taken into account), assuming a profit ratio of 30%...it will equate to 30% X 56.25 Million = SGD 16.875 Million. Total Net Cashflow to SQ is SGD -1.875 Million (based on SGD 15 Million savings) to SGD +3.125 Million (based on SGD 20 Million savings). So the net effect is that a drop 10% of PPS members completely out could possibly mean a negative cash flow depending on the amount of cash saving. The above model is very simplistic and of course I will not stand by it. It does not take into account members flying harder to achieve LPPS, TPPS and QPPS status.

Originally posted by SMK77 View Post Dropping YQ is a great move and I tip my hat off to SQ for going through with this. There is no explanation why this is charged separately. In terms of value, it's easier to calculate total cost for comparison. I value my miles at 2 SGD-Cents: There are NO changes to Zones 1 to 6 and Zone 8. SIN-BKK in Biz: Was 17.000 miles one-way plus 100 SGD fuel surcharge [440 SGD total]. Now is 20.000 miles and no surcharge [400 SGD total]. I am better off. SIN-CPT in Biz: Was 38.250 miles one-way plus 240 SGD fuel surcharge [1005 SGD total]. Now is 45.000 miles and no surcharge [900 SGD total]. I am better off and no complaint. Prices increase slightly for other zones. SIN-SYD in Suites: Was 63.750 miles one-way plus 190 SGD fuel surcharge [1465 SGD total]. Now is 80.000 miles and no surcharge [1.600 SGD total]. Thats increasing my total cost by 9%. SIN-FRA in Suites: Was 91.375 miles one-way plus 250 SGD fuel surcharge [2.080 SGD total]. Now is 115.000 miles and no surcharge [2.300 SGD total]. Thats increasing my total cost by 11%. SIN-JFK in Suites: Was 93.500 miles one-way plus 330 SGD fuel surcharge [2.200 SGD total]. Now is 120.000 miles and no surcharge [2.400 SGD total].

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post You need to start with one ticket and I see some seats in December immediately available. For all other flights, you can waitlist. Call them after a week and push for clearance. Take note that SIN-SFO has the highest loads of any flight into the US. They can actually sell the seats and have no need to hand out saver awards. If I were you, I would fly SIN-LAX on the non-stop in Business Class. Savers are available and the loads are very low. The difference between J and F is tiny anyway, so save the miles... December is difficult to get, but there are 4 seats available on random dates in February. Strange if you can't book them either. Even on the dates where I have taken 2 seats, I still can book another 4. I can take my entire family onboard Or were you trying to book offline through the call centre? My experience with my LHR-SIN flight (refer to a few posts above) was that the seats were 'available' online but 'not available' to the agents. They could only waitlist me. I tried calling back a few times until one helpful agent put me on hold for a good 5 minutes, and then she came back with the confirmation. She said she submitted a 'request' - I am not sure whether this was a manual call to the inventory management or a telex note in the system. You can give it a try - for the dates where seats are available online. For December, I doubt they can clear anything soon. You are using KF miles, right? Shouldn't you be booking online rather than calling them? Anyway, I agree with SMK77 that the difference between J and F is not much on this route but SQ upped the redemption rates for J much higher across the board while generally keeping the increases for F more reasonable. The difference in miles for J and F are relatively reflective of their actual difference. I think it is fair. And there is always that chance of an upgauge to the still-unredeemable Suites. Remember, 3 more fat planes are coming in the 2nd half of this year. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.5416913032531738, 0.45830872654914856]",krisflyer

Not that I did anything else to complain about her to KF or SQ. I accepted it. Perhaps just an expectation that was not met. Kind of like when you expect to be given a towel onboard of certain temperature and it was not. yauee: I have experienced the same (with pop up during selection for row 31 seats). But had no problem selecting any seats from row 32. Well as you said, I am not a typical pax. And yes, I am happy with who I am. I am happy with my life which takes downturn at the moment. And I choose not to expect much. Regarding hot towels, come on, when you fly for 6 years, and the towels were consistently hot, wouldn't you notice when it's not? Thus, my thread about not-so-hot-towel is something that I notice during my travel. And yes, I still accept what they are giving me, whether the towel is back to hot or just luke warm. But I don't feel as being mistreated. Thus your argument for being same as my hot towel case, is irrelevant. Well, if you read my post, when the agent did not see my seats, I made my own assumption that the agent has no access, thus I opt to ask for supervisor or to make a call back. But again, you said ""not just from assumptions/guessing"" when actually you called the agent a liar which imply that you assume or you guess that the agent has the full access of the seat map. Precisely, unless I know for sure that the agent has full access...I wouldn't be so quick to call her a liar. But again, I am sure you know that all agents have the same access level.

I like them heaps comparatively speaking. Things to do and decent meals to be had in them. Check in is usually painless too, and everything seems to go so well right up to the point that you get on the plane. The food onboard can be terrible. I'm not a fussy guy but have refused two meals on the basis they were entirely inedible. The strange thing being that even the crew agreed with me and went foraging to find alternatives. Amenity kits are poor and have declined in the last few years. Although they still provide PJ's which are more comfy than SQ imo. The entertainment systems fine, the equipment is showing its age but does the job admirably, its more a case of the crew service being so much of a gamble. I just find the whole in flight crew experience to be like sitting in a nice seat in Y. Seriously though, its not that bad.

" You earn the miles mostly from AMEX KrisFlyer Gold card? They transfer your miles monthly to KrisFlyer hence indirectly force you to use your miles even when you don't feel like flying and make you wait the following year's February to get the bonus 50% + 50% even when you need to use miles urgently. They make you pay S$60 admin fee every year but can waive the S$50 annual fee. S$1.60 spent = 1 mile or spend $12k per year, the rate goes down to S$0.80 = 1 mile. Citibank cards are the best in Singapore market...they only make you pay S$25 per transfer, meaning transfer your points to KrisFlyer ONLY when you need to fly, so that your miles don't get locked for 3 years. 7 must have credit cards to earn the most miles => Delta SkyMiles, KrisFlyer, THAI’s Royal Orchid Plus: 1. Citi PremierMiles Card: $1 = 1.2 miles (OR $0.83 = 1 mile, usually is $2.50 = 1 mile hence 3x) on ALL your spending at anywhere. Note: S$25 admin fee applies for each mileage transfer. Delta SkyMiles, KrisFlyer, THAI’s Royal Orchid Plus & Asia Miles: 2. Citi Platinum Visa/MasterCard: 5x rewards at departmental stores and supermarkets. Every $1 spent get 5 Citidollars = 2 miles, ie: $1 spent = 2 miles, compared to Citi Premiermiles: $1 = 1.2 miles Citibank 5X Rewards Merchants Department Stores (Note: Citi Rewards Card awards 10x points) Tangs .

Note: UOB Preferred Platinum American Express® Card also earn 10x points for every S$5 spent at any department store or any retail store worldwide that sells clothes, shoes, or bags as its main business activity. But it awards points for every S$5 spent. If you spend S$9.99, you will lose out the points for the balance S$4.99 part & miles are transferred in blocks of 10,000 miles, S$20 admin fee per transfer, so no good. Same for DBS Altitude Card, points are awarded for every S$5 spent and transferred in blocks of 2000 miles, S$42.80 annual fee applies, so no good. Can combine Citidollars from Clear Platinum, Platinum Visa/Mastercard & Citi Rewards Card to transfer to Frequent Flyer programs and pay S$25 admin fee once, by calling Citibank at 6225 5225. 5.

For such a traveller, the 25,000 miles needed for a domestic flight aren't such a bad deal. Very good point.

If it's wages, I would disagree as one can just move the same set of security personnel to another gate as quickly. It may be simpler (just only a tad) from a logistics standpoint. If it's related to equipment and thus cost, again, no as there are almost the equal number of those xray machines in the 'combined' security area. Revenue from merchant? Maybe. Why was T2 'security at gate' designed the way it was? Why has T3 changed? The concept is still - screening at gate. Can anyone with aiport security/planning experience chime in?

" Originally posted by golf1411 View Post Hello, Currently I have 23000 miles and in october 2007 I will fly back to asia so begin november 2007 I will have around 38000 miles. Normally my miles will expire end january 2008. But in april 2008 I will go back to asia so at that moment I will have another 15000 miles. So is there a possibility that I extend the 38000 miles that expire january 2008 so that I can get a gold card with my 50000 miles that I will reach in april 2008? If yes would it cost me something? Thanks in advance. hi golf and welcome to sqtalk. i am a little confused about your post. you say that you currently have 23,000 miles- when were these miles earned? did you earn these in january 2005, because you say they will expire in january 2008, and miles are redeemable for 3 years. or do you mean that for your qualifying year, you have currently accrued 23,000 miles? If it is the former, know that KF membership is recalculated at the end of your 12 month period, so all miles will be reset to zero for qualification purposes. therefore, if your miles were earned in january 2005, you currently have zero qualification miles towards silver or gold. however, you have 23,000 redeemable miles, which will expire in january 2008. if the miles were accrued in the past year, getting an extension until april 2008 from january 2008 I would have to say would be a pretty long bet. i think SQ makes exceptions when you might need an extra month to get your miles for the qualifying period, and you already have purchased a ticket that will show that you will fulfill the mileage, but an extra 3 months will most likely be rejected, especially when considering the changes singapore air has been implementing, but it never hurts to ask. hope this helps. =) ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5656757354736328, 0.4343242645263672]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Sounds very similar to my SQ BPs out of NRT last Feb. NH was performing the check in and they were trailing some new systems. Out spat some of the barest BPs I've ever seen - all that appeared were names, flight numbers for the NRT-SIN segment but not the onwards segment to MEL, seat numbers. I could've printed more credible ones at home with OLCI. They had to manually write the boarding time, gate number and missing flight number down. We were held up by the security people at Changi for a bit as they'd thought we were holding fake BPs. We were also assured the FFP numbers were locked in despite the lack of ""LH*G"" or the KF number which usually automatically alongside the ""LH*G"" - sure enough the miles posted a few days later.

I have sent an email to Krisflyer to appeal for extension for my qualification period to be extended till May. Hope it works. If I achieve my EG Status by May (considered to be within qualification period) - when will it expires? May 2012 ?? 1) I have used all my 40 000 miles to redeem a YYZ-SFO-SIN-MEL flight (1 way with SQ on SFO-SIN-MEL) , is it worth it? (and 20 hours stopover in Singapore) 2) Okay, the problem lies here ... The following months are my travel dates between Singapore - Melbourne. Jul - Oct (July is taken care of - from YYZ-MEL for redemption flight) Oct - Nov Jan - April April - July *I got 28 000 miles in my British Air Executive Club - I can redeem a ONE-WAY Award for the above trip. Now - should I put my miles (May trip) to A3 Miles & Bonus or Krisflyer? I would prefer to have both elite gold and a redeemable flight. A3 to Australia requires a 40 000 miles as compared to SQ for 27 000 miles (One way award) I also cancelled my UA YYZ-SFO flight (another ticket) and was given a credit of $250 plus after a $150USD deduction fee. UA don't fly to Aussie but Hong Kong/Japan. If I put my 20 000 miles in A3 - I can redeem a return flight from HK-SIN for my mum and use the UA Credit to purchase a return flight from HK-SIN for myself. If I put my 20 000 miles in Krisflyer - I can redeem a ONE-WAY SIN-MEL flight on SQ but I won't get EG (if assuming EG Appeal fail). Any suggestion on how I should plan my future trips?

" Access:*A C BP *G Any BP or status that trumps the above (e.g., *A F BP, Solitaire) Tips:It's one of the benefits of flying SK intra-Europe. The TG folks will try to steer you towards the SK Lounge; just say no. Turn left when you get to the junction where the path from the T3 shopping area joins the paths to the gates. It will be further down (leftwards) from the SK Lounge. It's one floor above the departure level. If you don't have heavy hand luggage, take the stairs. The elevator is very slow (though charming in its un-modernized way). The hot food tends to be available when the SQ passengers are expected to show up (roughly 3-4 hours before departure). That's OK; the lounge is open outside those hours. The sandwiches and munchies are still better than what can be found in the SK Lounge. For alcoholic drinks, you'll have to order from the staff at the bar. It's no big bother. The staff (reception and bar) are very friendly.

" 24 April 2009 Singapore Airlines is delighted to welcome one of Chinas leading chefs, Zhu Jun (朱俊), as the latest appointment to its International Culinary Panel. To mark his introduction to the Panel, Chef Zhu has exclusively crafted an entire range of mouth-watering creations for Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美), Singapore Airlines signature inflight Chinese dining experience. First Class customers on Singapore Airlines flights from Beijing and Shanghai from 1 May onwards can look forward to this all-new lineup, which includes salad of chicken and jellyfish with cucumber, double-boiled soup with pine mushroom, and stir-fried sliced beef fillet with dried chilli. His dishes will also be available to Business Class and Economy Class customers as menu choices. Customers onboard flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, and San Francisco (via Hong Kong) will continue to enjoy the popular current Shi Quan Shi Mei choices, including dishes designed by Singapores very own Sam Leong, another world-class chef on the International Culinary Panel. Winner of Excellent Chef at the 15th China Chef Festival, Chef Zhus dishes carry his signature Shanghainese influence, with a dash of Sichuan, Huaiyang, Fujian, and Guangdong touches. His latest masterpieces and upcoming creations will no doubt tantalise the palates of many Singapore Airlines customers. Chef Zhu is currently the Vice General Manager and Executive Chef of Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering, one of Chinas leading restaurant chains, and an icon synonymous with elegance, quality and service excellence. Today, Jade Garden is widely known for its commitment to showcasing the best that Chinese cuisine has to offer. Chef Zhus masterful authority of the art of Shanghainese cuisine is one of the main factors in the establishment of the Jade Garden brand. We are pleased to welcome Chef Zhu as the latest member of our International Culinary Panel, and we look forward to his spectacular creations, which I am sure will please even the most sophisticated of tastebuds, said Senior Vice President Product and Services Mr Yap Kim Wah. He added: The International Culinary Panel has truly made an indelible mark on inflight dining, and the addition of Chef Zhu to this lineup of some of the worlds greatest chefs reflects the amazing diversity of international cuisine we serve our customers. Chef Zhu began his illustrious culinary career in 1988, under the masterful apprenticeship of Mr He Ji Sheng, a well-known Min cuisine chef. Early in his career, he also had exposure to classical French and Italian cooking, and this had a significant influence on his present unique style. Chef Zhus innovative approach to Chinese cuisine draws inspiration from his well-rounded experience, deftly combining elements of Western cuisine with the art of traditional Chinese cooking. This resulted in his well-received re-interpretations of numerous traditional Chinese favourites. Many of these new creations, such as Sliced Ham with Honey Sauce, Tea Smoked Duck, and Sautee River Shrimp, have all since become Jade Gardens signature dishes. Chef Zhus outstanding culinary artistry has won him many accolades from peers and the media, including being named Famous Chef of China by the China Cuisine Association in 2006, and being awarded China Golden Chef Elite Cultivation Award twice in 2006 and 2007. He is also currently the Director of Shanghai Cuisine Association. It is an honour to be in the company of such illustrious names on Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. Creating dishes for inflight dining is a unique experience for me, and I take enormous pleasure from meeting this challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this new line of dining choices for Singapore Airlines customers, and I look forward to delighting them with more of my creations, said Chef Zhu. Chef Zhu will join seven other internationally-acclaimed chefs on the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. These master chefs, all authorities in their respective specialisations, are: George Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew James Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States of America); and Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom). About the International Culinary Panel Since its inception in 1998, the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel has continually redefined inflight dining. Tasked with satisfying the demands of an increasingly sophisticated traveller, the Panel has evolved over the years to reflect the diversity of excellent cuisine around the world. The Panel works closely with the Airlines own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available on board. Members on the Panel are Georges Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew James Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States); Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom); and Zhu Jun (China). About Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering Since its establishment in 1999, Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering Co. Pte. Ltd. has developed two key brands - Jardin de Jade and Paradise Garden  and operate a total of 15 restaurants in the Greater China region, including Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou and Macau. Known for its outstanding research and development capability, consistently high product quality, excellent service and elegant dining ambience, the company has won several accolades home and abroad, including being named in the list of Chinas Top 100 Restaurant Brands. Jade Gardens mission is to promote modern Chinese culinary culture to both domestic and overseas customers, presenting to the world the charm and diversity of Chinese cuisine.

" As I wrote in my original post, I think these are excellent moves in the right direction. Does this make PPS programme perfect? Nope. I want easier access to J/F Savers as a TPP. But so far my waitlists for Saver awards have been mostly cleared. Of course by using Saver awards, I am usually more flexible in flight time/date choices. So far, their waitlist clearance have been quite reasonable. From what I have been told, there may be some changes coming. What those are, I don't know yet. I like that they are listening to our feedbacks nowadays (YQ PPS value inclusion, arrival access to lounges, extension of Reserve Value validity, etc), rather than the genius bean counters who made them cut costs everywhere to survive. For me, the only TPP benefits I can remember still missing from the 'golden era' are: - Anytime SKL access (when flying other airlines -- with no guest allowance) - Unpublished benefits like birthday gifts, which is a nice touch to remind SGD25k annual spenders that they are appreciated. Things that I think will help to make us feel more loved : - More consistent onboard recognition (CX is very good at this -- although with not so sociable crew-in-charge, we risk having to endure a lame conversation at the beginning of the flight ) - Complimentary upgrades for special occassions. Okay, if upgrades during/near birthdays are too many and too costly, maybe do that for some PPS milestones? Every five years in the club perhaps?

" Originally posted by concept|infinit View Post Like cant they just serve the J menu offerings in F/R in such a situation? Given the recent reports of overbooking, I think your suggestion would undercut the price premium of F/R over J in the short run, and possibly over the medium term. That's probably something SQ didn't want to live with. I'm not saying the premium makes sense; only that the action (not op-upping and instead downgrading and offering compensation) seems consistent with the pricing and branding strategy. If there's anything we know, it's that SQ tries for consistency (even if egregiously mis-applied, as in the TPR access debacle). And consistency about the 'no op-up policy' (notwithstanding UMD's string of successes ) is one of the cornerstones of their strategy. Originally posted by concept|infinit View Post I can't accept that someone who paid for a Business Class ticket yet alone someone in the PPS ranks (yes, there are thousands of you lot I reckon but still) can be dumped to Y like that. I would be really pissed if I spent >$25,000 a year on SQ and received such treatment.. and I would have really kicked up a fuss there. Why do you seem to assume that a different flight was not offered in order for the passenger to remain in the same cabin? Or, if being on the same flight was important, that a refund of the fare difference because of the downgrade was not offered? Life is full of tradeoffs, and airline overbooking is a part of the tribulations of a road warrior. Such instances are supposed to happen very infrequently on SQ, but again, who knows what tweaking was done on the overbooking software in light of the downturn. Fact is, the op-up, even for elites, isn't, and has never been, one of SQ's selling points, and what I'm seeing is a very rigorous (some would say overly rigid) implementation of that strategy. (This is part of the reason why, for example, a number of the BA Golds I worked with chose to take their chances on BA WTP instead of SQ Y on LHR-SIN, and why I sometimes chose to fly CX from LHR to SIN despite the more circuitous route to SIN.

For First Class redemption from partner airlines' FFP, the inventory is 1 seat per flight. I used my KF miles. Thanks - I was thinking that must be the case. I forgot to mention earlier that, for the same SQ flights in the same period, I had first tried using my UA miles but had no success whatsoever. Also, last month, I redeemed 2 SQ J tickets intra-Asia using LH miles with no problem, but again with no success using UA miles. I recall reading something on flyertalk several months ago about how UA doesn't make available SQ redemption seats using UA MP miles. My experience has proved that to be true. Does anyone know if that's true in general, or only on certain routes/class of service? The only good thing about redeeming UA miles is no fuel surcharge, but if the seats are not available to begin with, their miles are useless (on SQ at least, not sure about on their other *A partners) and I'll gladly pay whatever fuel surcharges LH imposes on redemption seats!

" ""PPS club, is it MUCH better than *EG ?"" To answer the original question: No, IMO it's certainly not MUCH better than *EG. However as taipeiflyer pointed out, whether the PPS club brings any additional benefits over *G depends on the individual traveler. I personally feel that I did not receive any substantial benefits beyond ordinary * G recognition for being a ""regular"" PPS member. However once I qualified for Solitaire membership I felt I could take greater advantage of PPS perks. Waiting list clearance with SQ is faster and there's an additional PPS card for your spouse, so it's easier to take friends or family to the lounge when traveling together. Also SQ cabin crews tend to give you the illusion that you enjoy greater recognition with the airline (of course at the end all that matters to them is how much you paid for your ticket) and they tend to be more attentive to your needs (eg. you can choose your meal before other passengers to ensure they don't run out etc.). PPS membership is certainly not worth any mileage (or rather PPS value-) runs but if you happen to travel a lot on SQ it can make a difference (especially as Solitaire)...

I find that the counter staff in SIN ask me the question posed to cscs1956 whenever I ask them to credit to miles to an FFP other than KF, regardless of the COS. It's probably because I book my SQ flights online while logged onto my KF account. The correct answer, even in Y, is just 'I'd like my miles to go to xxx [designated partner FFP]' ... with a smile, of course . The KF status part is irrelevant anyway for Y travel. I think it's just due to the fact that a traveller's profile links the partner FFN to the KF profile.

This loses the on-line discount but may be worth it on very popular routes. For example, evidently with QF phone bookings you can make them slightly before the on-line opens (cost an extra 2500 points). What I am seeking to do is to maximise my chances of securing the awards that I am seeking. Notes & Background 1/ That in my case I am looking to redeem in C (Business) for Saver Awards where I have noted that many routes have a maximum of 2 tickets, though some have 4. 2/ I am booking for 4.

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post This place opened last week and it is pretty impressive to be fair and a big improvement on the old place.

The capacity is clearly larger but the problem that will bring is the large numbers of TG pax who don't want to use their crappy JCL lounges. Handy location as well much closer to SQ usual D gates. For those who are familiar with it the area it's close to the JL Lounge. I'm passing through BKK tomorrow and it was/is my plan to give SKL a try given its central location. I was fortunate last Sunday my TG flight left from gate F1 so I managed the EVA lounge directly upstairs and overlooking there and it, too, is miles better than those crappy, dirty, sticky, poorly maintained TG lounges.

I want to book as follows: SYD-SIN-KUL-SIN-SYD Basically I waitlisted syd-sin one way on a separate date(which cleared straight away), I tried to waitlist syd-sin-kul with a stopover in sin but I couldn't wait list it for some reason so I only did syd-sin.

She said she will see if she can link it and she did in the end. But they did not take miles out for that sector only the other 3 sectors. It has all been ticketed and confirmed and I have made payment for the taxes. Do I keep quiet ? what should I do?

" Hi, wonder if anyone has any experience with this. I issued some redemption ticket on Avianca / AAdvantage for travel on Star Alliance / OneWorld flights. Avianca / AAdvantage are USA/Western based programs and typically, they issue the ticket based only on ""Last"" and ""First"" name, with the middle name completely omitted from the ticket. For example, ""Lau Tak Wah"" will have the name of the passenger shown on the ticket as ""Lau"" under Last Name and ""Tak"" under ""First Name"" with ""Wah"" not shown anywhere. On the other hand, ""Lau Tak Wah"" 's passport will show ""Lau Tak Wah"". I've had such tickets issued a couple of times in USA and Europe and had had no problems getting the boarding pass issued and then clearing immigration. I guess in the Western world, they are used to just checking up on the ""Last"" and ""First"" name, even if the Middle name is not shown on the boarding pass but shown on the passport. I've recently had such tickets issued on JAL and NH for travel from SIN - NRT, NRT - PVG respectively. Its the first time that I'll have only ""Last"" and ""First"" name shown on my boarding pass clearing immigration in Asia.

Link: http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_807022.html And Link: http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_808702.html It is apparent that SIA's Public Communications and Media Affairs Department remains silent and has failed to inform its Krisflyer Elite Gold and the Star Alliance Gold members who would be affected by a supposedly ""ongoing trial"" at selected airports - hopefully aimed at enhancing our travel experience. Apparently, during this time, we would still be welcome to board with priority, but at normal (not priority) designated lanes. Communication platforms for SIA are aplenty. Krisflyer members could be updated via the monthly e-Newsletters and the krisflyer.com website. Star Alliance Gold members and the travelling community could have been communicated of this via the ""News Alerts"" on the infamous singaporeair.com website. For the larger tech-savvy audience, communications could be through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. However, to the dismay of many Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold members, nothing has been communicated to-date by the airline. At this moment, it seems that SIA is not aligned with the ""benefits"" as stipulated under its own Krisflyer program, which has been mapped to the Star Alliance framework. a) Star Alliance website http://www.staralliance.com/en/benef...ilver-status/; and* b) Krisflyer brochure https://www.singaporeair.com/pdf/pps...efitsGuide.pdf Is the airline now signaling to its Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold members that they are no longer as relevant today, than compared to the past, and are more discriminated today, when compared to PPS and Solitare members?

" Well , with all due respect : 1. I had taken AC1/AC2 before (in fact many times!) and I dislike their services. (Compare SQ w AC , which will you choose? It's up to individual pref and I choose SQ.) Apart from that, they can't offer me X July and requires me to change to a later date which will result in: Additional payment for accommodation in Toronto & MEL / Changes for transportation in YYZ & MEL. All these cost me $ & time. 2. SQ promise me the flight from YYZ-LGA-JFK-SIN-MEL with YQ paid and miles deducted. This booking was made 2 weeks ago. They've ample time to inform me about this matter however no one told me about such stuff UNTIL I call in to double-check my booking. (Seating/Immigration/Baggage etc). Thanks to the agent who took the extra effort to call up JFK else it's going to be a hassle in JFK. A minor stuck in a foreign land with limited resources. Yes, they're going to deny boarding until I find a stranger to get me onboard. 3. I called like XX hours with Krisflyer (see my previous thread) and it took me like 4-6 re-issuance of etix to get this flight : YYZ-LGA-JFK-SIN-MEL. I cancelled my 'fav' NH flight from ORD-NRT etc. 4. It will costs me about $800 odd plus for YYZ-NRT-SIN-MEL while the latter flight only cost me about $600+ YQ. Moreover, I am getting a deal. 76.5K for JFK-MEL while I pay only 70K for YYZ-MEL (with the same metal / *Booking.) 5. Radiation - as you said maybe bullsh*t however better be safe than sorry. Apart from that // I was previously offered NRT-HND (change in terminal) // that's outside the airport. No offense for writing that much // I do accept your opinion here, as fussy/choosy/picky as I might be - I believe everyone here wants GOOD SERVICE / GOOD QUALITY / GOOD FOOD whenever they're onboard. If not, why choose First/Biz class? An economy class will do , right? We pay a good number of miles for redemptions and if SQ were to offer me OZ/NH - I would not mind. Definitely not AC. It's just like how some folks would avoid UA like a plague. (UA offers flat bed too//but not from YYZ) Same logic. Lastly, why not UA ? If one is not picky/choosy/fussy after-all.. I'm not asking for the sky. I'm not demanding that I get first class because of a mistake. I'm just trying to request for a similar itinerary where I'll get to board SQ metal , as per normal.

Unfortunately the SIN-KCH leg (operated by Silkair) is cancelled and I was automatically rebooked on the next flight which leaves SIN the following morning. This results in my layover in SIN being increased from 1.5hr to 15hrs. I phoned up Krisflyer and was told there is nothing they can do about it, as ""Singapore Airlines reserve the right to make schedule changes"". I would have thought they will at least offer me meal voucher or an accommodation (my layover is between 5pm - 8am). A friend of mine who recently missed the connecting flight to KCH was given meal voucher plus rebooked on another flight via KL arriving KCH just 2hrs later. They agent said as I am holding an award ticket, I do not enjoy the same right as a passenger who hold a revenue ticket. In other words expect nothing and just sit and wait. To add salt to the injury, I was also told that if I were to leave the airport, I will have to pay for the additional airport tax upon re-entering SIN. I had a look at the SQ website but couldn't find any information about long transit or compensation due to flight cancellation/schedule changes. I find all these a bit bizzare, at one point I thought I was dealing with Iberia. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.9019442796707153, 0.09805573523044586]",krisflyer

Fortunately you can achieve QPP even if you bank your miles in a partner FFP. If you travel with your family, the QPP baggage allowance can be very nice. As LionCity pointed out, QPP privileges were also hacked down in the Great Devaluation. As for QPP qualification, it looks simple on the face of it: S$25,000 spending in your membership year.

" You'll get miles posted to KF...... in time, but other than that there is no benefit. The only upside I have when flying with them is that their J is about the same price as SQ/LH Y on the same sector so i 'splurge' on Executive Class and then get all the benefit direct from AI. With regards entry into *A I did hear a couple of weeks ago whilst there that LH had pulled out of 'negotiations' because they felt it was far too hard to get AI upto standard. Personally I don't find them so bad, service was fine but again that might be partly because i took J......which was definately worth it in comparison to SQ's Y only for the airport assistance i got in Mumbai from AI staff (tip: 1:40hr is not enough to transit there). EDIT: One thing i forgot..... you'll need to keep all your boarding passes for claiming back your miles. The guys in India have no idea they even partner SQ so you'll need to submit directly.

" Don't worry Kyo, this is all within the spirit of healthy forum discussion. To reiterate, highlight and emphasizing my earlier points: 1. This is only applicable for spending from now till 15th Jan 2009 at those listed PPS AMEX promo outlets for this discussion. 2. If one's preference is for NW, TG or CX miles, then spending on Citi Premier Miles card is the way to go. 3. If one wants to have the flexibility of SQ, NW, TG or CX miles, then Citi card is also the way to go. But should one decide to convert to SQ miles at a later juncture, and he/she did spend at the PPS AMEX promo outlets during the promo period, then he/she will face the opportunity costs of not crediting to the PPS AMEX card (2.0 minus 1.6 or 1.5 or 1.4.....1.2). 4. The 1.6 factor (maximum) for Citi is for discussion purposes only. This factor will depreciate should you spend more. E.g. Should you spend SGD100K on Citi card, your earn factor will drop to 1.4, a case of diminishing marginal utility. 5. There is also a PPS AMEX promo/benefit where you will get a quasi 35K miles voucher, which I have excluded for the purpose of this analysis, but nonetheless a value/benefit for at least half of PPS AMEX card holders. 6. Then again, I would agree with you if one's Citi card anniversary year ends on 15th Jan 2009 for example, and he/she is at year-to-date spending of say SGD40K or above but below SGD50K, and based on incremental value-add, it is more worthwhile to go ahead and spend on Citi card at those PPS AMEX promo outlets as it will garner an additional 10K points once it hit the SGD50K spending mark. 7. Ceteris paribus, my opinion is if you are keen to get SQ miles, and till 15th Jan 2009, should you patronise any of those PPS AMEX promo outlets, it should be a pain-free decision to use PPS AMEX card over the Citi card. Because the next dollar you spend at these promo outlets on PPS AMEX earns you 2.0 (with no spending hurdle), while Citi earns you between 1.2 and 1.6 only (with spending hurdle). And that's what I meant exactly when I end my previous post, ""enjoy while it last"" with this PPS AMEX double miles promo from now till 15th Jan 2009 by maximising miles earning on spending at those promo outlets.

" PPSV (the value itself, not the programme) has never made sense since they started it. I have had some frankly bizarre PPSV's over the years, especially on RTW tickets as tfung says on the first post of this thread and also on one way tickets. I haven't flown a CRTWSTAR or FRTWSTAR ticket for a while now so no idea if it is still the same but some of the values on one way tickets are strange. On this subject I have to say that while I can see why they went down the value route rather than PPS sectors, and indeed others are now following suit, I don't think they fully considered the implications of dropping LPP and then introducing PPSV Reserve. I was speaking to a fellow TPP SQTalker in Singapore last week who has got over 6 years worth of PPSV Reserve. As a result he has been flying CX, JL etc and keeping top tier status in OW as well.

" My first experience on SQ goes years back: I was flying on an award ticket from JFK to FRA on the 747 in a Sky Suite – an unforgettable experience. When I moved to Singapore, I was thrilled as my job includes some traveling around in Asia. Some thoughts after 12 weeks… First of all, SQ is listening (and lurking). Although a lowly KF member at that time only, a letter of complaint to the CEO was responded by a phone call to my office. SQ took me out for lunch and was keen on learning more about my travel patterns and needs. Thumbs up. Products. The new business class is a great product and I very much like the design and comfort of these seats. Food is still better than on many other airlines – and olive oil is one of the nice touches that survived any cost cutting (only outdone by NH – they also serve salt and sesame so that one can dip the bread with the olive oil). I love the Sky Suites and I am very sorry to see that product being phased out. The difference between First and Business on the 77W is marginal, you will not see me in F on the 77W very often. The Regional F product is a disgrace for SQ – advertising Suites on the one hand and then forcing you on an overnight flight from Dubai into this inferior product is just disgusting. There must be a reason why you won’t find any information about that product on their webpage. Thumbs down. SQ should keep the 747. PPS. Yes, I made it – now I will loose my meal in F only to a fellow pax if he is TPP (unless SQ is changing this non-sense policy of catering only one meal for certain dishes even for fully booked flights). I support SQ in their decision to base qualification on PPS Value. As an airline you don’t care about how often a customer is boarding or how many miles he is flying – bottom line, revenue is the only thing that counts. But comparing PPS to LH’s SEN (*G), I don’t know why SQ hates it elites. Reduced services fees – where? Business Class Check-In and Lounge access when you fly Economy – you gotta be kidding me. Preferred treatment for award tickets or seats – history. Milage earnings on SQ for F is a joke (with and without PPS bonus). Why would that motivate me to spend 25,000 SGD on SQ? Changi Airport is still a mystery to me – SQ is failing to meet my expectations for a smooth travel experience there. Screening at the gate is not a smart thing – where are the priority lines? Even flying in F, there is a huge gap to LH which I am familiar with (their F Terminal in FRA is still setting the benchmark). It seems that my airplane is always parked on the gate that is furthest away from the lounge and flying in F you are not only facing different experiences in terminals 2 and 3 but you are also divided into paying and non-paying pax with different access rights to the Private Room. Worst thing I have ever seen – I don’t feel like apologizing for spending 360.000 KF miles on a redemption ticket in F. Competition. Forced SQ to introduce their 77W to India. Will force them to re-think their premium prices for Suites. Will hopefully make them listen more closely to their elites. And definitely has already lost them a lot of business due to their unthoughtful changes in their offerings and their offensive behaviour towards its elites. Definitely the most powerful force to move SQ. If you are a staff member – keep doing a great job. I appreciate outstanding service experiences and I am making sure that SQ knows about it.

Maybe an opportunity to burn some of the 400K LifeMiles I am sat on and am scared of using as I cannot spend another two hours of my life just to cancel a flight. I would reiterate advice you have probably heard or read before : only use your LM is you are absolutely certain you will be travelling. Or that your travel plans won't change. I experienced the infamous LM cancellation experience a couple of weeks ago. Spent 6 hours over 5 days with multiple people in various 'departments' over the phone and email and they couldn't cancel the ticket. Back in March I had an involuntary schedule change by TG which resulted in the ticket being reissued from Taca (202) to Avianca (134) ticket stock, which in itself was another ordeal and another story for another thread, and apparently this meant the LM call centre couldn't access the ticket to complete the cancellation. And in the meantime inventory on the new flights I wanted to book (to avoid a 14 hour stop in BKK that TG had left me with, amongst other reasons) had disappeared... so I had to rescind my cancellation request and make sure that they DO NOT cancel my existing itinerary. So far they've not touched it and the ticket looks normal, but I'll only be able to relax once I'm able to check in and make it onboard the flipping plane.... It has made me rather wary of using them for anything other than very, very simple point to point itineraries with no connections or flights for imminent travel as I really will not be able to hack spending 3 hours on the phone with them trying to reissue or cancel a ticket.

But in terms of refusing the BTC because wanting something off the in-flight menu, it won't be a problem. I have done this quite a few times where the things listed on the F menu looks more appealing than the BTC F selection I had pre-ordered and never have the crews made a fuss about it. Overall it makes sense considering you'll know which particular dish you'll be getting by BTC but highly unlikely you'll know what the onboard menu on your flight will offer until the day you board the plane.

" Originally posted by tris View Post Great info. i have 2 questions - Can it accumulate towards PPS qualification as well if travelling on business class - Can i use the silver kris lounge if i am on economy class with star alliance partner as PPS. Thanks! PPS qualification is SQ metal only. Code shares don't count. Meaning: You have to fly only on SQ/MI on F or C to register PPSV. F or C on other airlines do not count, though they count as status miles for ES/EG. Either way, you also get the redeemable miles. You can use any * lounge if flying on any * carrier when holding *G status with any carrier. PPS is *G, so your answer will be yes. Do watch out though for UA and US FFPs. Their members do not have access to domestic US lounges unless flying on an international itinerary. This rule however, does not apply to FFPs other than UA and US.

Elite miles are earned only thru flying but Krisflyer miles can be earned through credit cards, hotel stays, etc. I am guessing that you have flown about 26,936 miles or slightly more. When you hit 25K or slightly above, you achieved KF Silver in May thus the counter has reset. You have flown 1,936 miles since achieving Silver and would require another 23,064 miles to get Gold.

" Originally posted by TONY_SQ268 View Post I decided that it would be nice to fly on the A380 so arranged to depart Australia out of Sydney rather than Adelaide where I live. However, due to the way in which SQ have (I think) complicated their fare structure with the new R class, an F class RTW only allows travel in business (D) class on the A380. So I was wondering if anybody might know if on a F RTW ticket I will be able to use the SK First Class lounge at Sydney airport, because my boarding pass will be issued as Business Class. Also if I want to use the BTC service, would I be able to choose from the F class menu or have to use the J class menu? First of all, welcome to SQTalk!. I don't think you will get access to the SKL F at SYD with a Business Class Boarding Pass. In fact I'm pretty sure you won't. FWIW the F lounge at SYD is no better than the J side anyway, in fact I prefer the latter. Even better than both is the NZ lounge at the bottom of the corridor. I am sure the same will apply to your BTC, but I don't suppose it would hurt to ask. On a related note, as much as I can understand you want to 'fly the A380' etc, I would personally go for F on either than 744 or the 77W rather than J on the A380. There is no surcharge for F on the 77W. F is still F is still F, and especially on SQ, F is not something that should be given up easily, A380 or not. Just my tuppence worth...

" Originally posted by EKrew View Post Taipeiflyer - why would you say so ? I was just sharing an example of the small majority of cases whereby members take advantage of the airline. Trust me, i had better things to do at 03:00LT when i posted this message than to make up stories. There are two sides to every coin. PPS/TPPS members who take advantage of the goodwill of airline is not something I myself do not find it pleasant and degrade the image of other PPS/TPPS. I think it is good that EKrew do let us know how some of these priority pax behave. Many of us are loyal customers of SQ and support her in good and bad times and we have to pay a premium for a seat in either C or F Class over other airlines. The unapologetic attitude of SQ in raising the PPS/Solitaire threshold while at the same time reducing benefits itself does is not exactly the best way in giving us that endearing feeling to SQ. For example trying to bring my 4 year old daughter to the lounge together with my wife is that I almost have to beg SQ to let us in as a family and lounge entry for the 3 of us is considered by SQ to be doing us a really big favour despite spending an average of 50K a year on premium travel. In fact, up to a point, I make it a point to fight harder if there are ticketing issues or enjoy more of the remaining benefits from SQ. However, I will not be drawn to acting in a ""cheap manner"" as describe by EKrew. In my personal belief is that yes there are ""cheap"" or ""PITA"" members but most of us are not.

" Hi Inix, Unfortunately I don't think you'll be getting gold based on what you've mentioned... although I'd be very happy to be proved wrong! The key (see in bold below) is that you must travel 50,000 miles in your Elite Silver membership year, not 50,000 miles in a year (the only exception is if you fly 50,000 miles in the 1 year after enrolling into Krisflyer, which I believe is what Vtac82 did) From http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...elitegold.jsp? Becoming a KrisFlyer Elite Gold Member Your membership year will be the 12-month period from the date of your enrolment as a KrisFlyer member or upgrade to KrisFlyer Elite Silver status. During this time, you may qualify for KrisFlyer Elite Gold status by earning the required number of Elite miles. KrisFlyer Elite Gold status will be yours when you achieve 50,000 Elite miles in any class of service on Singapore Airlines, SilkAir or any Star Alliance airline during your Elite Silver membership year, and credit them to your KrisFlyer account.

" Scoot, TigerAir to join Singapore Airlines' KrisFlyer Scoot and Tigerair will join Singapore Airlines' KrisFlyer frequent flyer scheme, allowing KrisFlyer miles to be earned and burned on both low-cost airlines. From April 2015 travellers will be able to trade their KrisFlyer Miles ""for vouchers to travel on Scoot and Tigerair flights,"" according to Singapore Airlines. By year's end passengers on Scoot and Tigerair will also be able to earn KrisFlyer Miles, although this is expected to be offered as a cost-extra fare option similar to the approach taken by Jetstar with its Qantas points-earning Jetstar Plus and Max fare bundles. Singapore Airlines has not detailed how many KrisFlyer Miles it'll take to book a seat on Scoot or Tigerair, let alone what the earning rates on those airlines will be. Scoot has established a foothold in the Australian market with flights from Sydney, Perth and the Gold Coast, and will add Melbourne to its network in November. Although the airline's ScootBiz cabin (above) is more akin to premium economy than to conventional business class, many business travellers on a budget  especially the self-employed  consider it a cost-effective way to jet to Singapore. Scoot will take delivery of its first new Boeing 787 this month and begin Perth-Singapore flights on the Dreamliner from February 5, with its other Australian destinations being upgraded to the Boeing 787 later this year. Source: http://www.ausbt.com.au/scoot-tigera...ines-krisflyer The CEO of SIA's subsidary, John from Virgin Australia suggested that no airlines can successfully exist without a frequent flyer program, and today SIA's Tiger Airways and Scoot suffered because of this. With their network expanding and SQ is intending to dump some of its unprofitable routes to the low cost off-shoot, it is reasonable to see finally they have listened and Krisflyer miles can soon be earned and burnt on Scoot and Tigerair. I am sure this will increase the convenience of frequent flyers who fly SQ often, and further increase the attraciveness of the scheme to budget travellers.

" AAdvantage, United Mileage Plus, US Airways Dividend Miles every 18 months. There is good and bad. For frequent flyers who fly regularly benefit most, those who clock miles mostly from credit card point don't. I don't understand how it would benefit frequent flyers more than the ones get their miles using credit cards. Any type of transaction will extend the expiration. Krisflyer and Asia miles need a lot of miles to redeem tickets. Asia Miles have more variety like hotel stays, vouchers, gifts etc. Northwest airlines' worldperks is the best. For any destination in North and southeast asia, you need 20k in economy class and 30k in business class, and can redeem on Northwest, malaysia airlines, china airlines, china eastern/southern and can mix the airlines on your redemption itinerary. Compare to Krisflyer or Asia Miles, say if you want to redeem a ticket on business class from singapore to tokyo, you need 70k miles, on NW's worldperks, you need 30k miles only! Air Canada Aeroplan is better in this case. It is 30K miles in C for North to South Asia. And one can fly SQ. In a nutshell, support Citibank cards & NW's Worldperks!!

" Originally posted by chisquared View Post Not necessarily. You might still find banking your miles with SQ to be more valuable because you want to be able to use those miles for redemption. Bear in mind that it is generally quite difficult to redeem premium class tickets on SQ using miles from other *A carriers. That point, to me, is especially compelling when the excess miles you'd fly above 50k isn't enough to earn elite status on another airline. Not to mention that I'm not really sure what I'd do with a second *G card, but I suppose they do have their uses in very specific sets of circumstances. Also, it seems to defeat the purpose of having a *G card when you switch to OW as soon as you earn one. However, it does seem like Chucksta cares a lot about elite qualification (excessively so, if you ask me), so in his case I guess the advice makes sense. Dont quite agreed with you - in a polite way If you ever tried to redeem KF miles for travel trips, you will know that there is always limited seats allocated by SQ for travelers using KF miles or they want ALOT of miles from you to the extend, you might as well buy direct on their website. An alternative miles accumulation on OW for flight redemption can be good as an alternative to SQ. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.5525603294372559, 0.44743964076042175]",krisflyer

" Originally posted by sfvoyage View Post Thanks, LUKE. This means that, in my example above, in the absence of the requal loophole/rule, I could safely switch to focus on another airline (if I so choose) Aug-Sep, and come back to SQ Oct-Dec, for the purpose of PPS requalification. However, due to the requal rule, as described by JJPB3, I should still stay with SQ Aug-Sep, as this will help me requalify easier next year. Yes, your understanding is correct. To summarize, in your case, there are two PPS issues: 1) Early reset of requalification: SQ has been resetting member accounts which have enough sectors/miles 3 months before the formal requalification month. Members which account has been reset, can start earning for the next year's requalification (thus having 15 months max to requalify). Any miles earned before the reset time, will not be carried over to next year's requalification. 2) Requalification loophole: If you fly SQ F/J Aug-Sep, it will add up to your yearly average sectors/yearly average miles, which will help you to requalify easier in tough years when you can only meet at least half the sectors/miles required. However, there is no guarantee that this will continue forever, especially with the rumoured qualification criteria changes. Excess sectors earned in each year also (currently) draw you closer to Solitaire PPS membership. Hope this helps.

" Visited the new SKL in ICN, and it's probably the best Star Alliance lounge in ICN. Quite centrally located. Once you reach the top of the escalator, you will see lots of DFS goods strewn all over the place. It's a packing and delivery zone for all DFS purchases. It's a mess, and isnt the most welcoming scene before you reach the lounge. It's the same situation for OZ's Central Business Class lounge. Fortunately, the entrance to the lounge is across an overhead bridge and away from the mess. Entrance Batik motifs on the ceiling leading to the lounge. Rest of the lounge was bright and spacious. It did get a little crowded as the evening passed, but seats remained plentiful (but this could be because the load on SQ603 was quite light that night) Food was very good and beautifully presented. Better than SKL MNL, but not as varied as LHR. Overall a much better place to relax before your flight compared to the OZ lounge.

" They have not done this right, both at home soil, and at some overseas stations. No priority lanes are available for *G/KFEG to board ex-Singapore. Singapore Airlines attributed this to operational challenges ex-Singapore. For overseas stations, too much inconsistency. A few months ago, boarding SQ825 ex-Shanghai was a joke. Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Ho Chi Minh City do it right. Priority lanes are available for *G/KFEG at these stations. As mentioned in my letter, pre-2012, Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold passengers boarded through the “Priority Lane”, reserved for ""PPS Club; Solitaire; First Class; Business Class; Krisflyer and Star Alliance Gold"". This was standardized across all airports worldwide. In my opinion, this was a better and well managed boarding process than now. Also, how can these ""operational challenges"" be Singapore Airlines specific? Wouldn't other Star Alliance carriers have similar challenges, from identical hubs operated by Singapore Airlines? Why can other Star Alliance carriers still dedicate priority boarding lanes for Star Alliance Gold passengers? Therefore, my query to Management if their Committee had: ""b) studied and evaluated how other Star Alliance partners board their priority passengers (includes Star Alliance Gold frequent flyers) – at Singapore Changi International Airport and other Singapore Airlines worldwide destinations?""

" Originally posted by whanafi View Post Be careful with this card - it has a double whammy on overseas charges. First, it converts all amounts to US dollars, then does another conversion to Sing$. Then it adds the Visa charge - 1%, and another FX fee of 2.5%. Those are very expensive miles you are collecting. All Singapore-issued credit cards (Visa, Mastercard or Amex) convert to USD first, then to SGD. The bank commission is dependent on which bank issued the card. For Citibank, I believe it's 2.5% (which is inclusive of Visa's 1% commission). That is hardly the highest (eg. UOB PRVI Miles charges a total of 3.25%). Originally posted by whanafi View Post 25$ for every redemption request and 3 weeks to process. Seems like the Amex PPS card is a better deal if you are crediting miles frequently - automatic transfer each month without charge. [disclaimer] I do not have any relationship with a card issuer - just tend to read the fine print. Firstly, unless you have PPS, you can't get the Amex PPS card. Secondly, you are earning less miles with the PPS card (0.2 miles per $ less for local charges, 1 mile per $ less for overseas charges). Thirdly, your miles are credited each month, starting the three year countdown to expiry. With the Premiermiles, they don't expire. Transfer only when required. The only on instance when the PPS card is better is when you buy tickets on singaporeair.com, where you earn 2 miles per $. But then again, I get that as well for Maybank Horizon card, which earns 2 miles per $ for all air tickets, not just from singaporeair.com. The PPS Amex card (like it's Gold and PPS Solitaire versions) is really quite lacklustre...

" Help: KrisFlyer vs Miles &amp; More Hi, I am helping my friend, who travels frequently on SQ to other ASEAN destination such as KUL, CGK and BKK, to decide if she should switch to Miles & More. She will be due for Elite Silver after her trip to Hanoi next week. I was told by some friends that Miles & More offer 150% on Y bookings. Also, according to the below website, she can earn a minimum of 750 miles if she flies to KUL on SQ, am I interpreting it correctly? Hence, M&M looks attractive as she is always booked on Y booking class. So, I am wondering if she could attain Star Gold faster through Miles & More. http://www.lufthansa.com/online/port...81&cid=1000357 Also, although it may seem easier to earn more mileage on M&M as compared to KF, is more M&M miles needed to redeem any future award tix? What are the other pros & cons if she made the switch after getting her Elite Silver? Or is there any other Star Alliance FFP that can help her attain *G faster? Should she just stay on and credit all future miles to her KrisFlyer? Thanks a lot for your help. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.700361967086792, 0.299638032913208]",krisflyer

Originally posted by StarG View Post I must confess I finally gave in to the temptation to order replacement card & tags. They arrived today (left card is the old one): I must say I am pleasantly surprised with the changes. I am pleased to know SQ listened to the customers about the card designs. The cards and tags now look much better: - As mentioned before, the ""KRISFLYER SINGAPORE AIRLINES PPS CLUB SOLITAIRE"" are now in white color (with slight shadowing effect) which made it easier to read and they are 'built into' the card image, rather than 'added on' like previously. I am pretty sure this one will be durable. - Years Qualified is back. - SQ logo is now in real metallic (gold) compared to 'gold image' previously (seems like for QPP it is 'real silver metallic' as opposed to 'silver image' previously). - Star Alliance Gold logo is slightly enlarged. - TPP tags are now in gold, differentiated from QPP tags (silverish/pink). - New kebaya patterns on the tags to match the cards. - The new cover is very well designed, the best one I have seen so far. I think it is REAL leather! My only suggestion is to make the kebaya pattern a bit thicker so it doesn't get hidden behind the leather tags window profile. Very well done, SQ.

" Recently took SQ337 for the first time on my trip back from Düsseldorf to Singapore. As J passages I had access to the Open Sky Lounge in the non-Schengen Pier C. The lounge is situated centrally in the pier, while reaching the gate was quick and easy. The lounge itself was rather underwhelming and I only spend about 15min there before walking over to the gate. It is open daily from 5:15am to 9:00pm. Facilities include limited selection of drinks, very few hot and cold dishes, Wifi, and newspapers and magazines. The Open Sky Lounge is basically a pay-per-visit lounge and you get access with the following partners: Priority Pass - Lounge Club - Lounge Key - Lounge Pass - Diners Club Overall, this lounge is nothing too special and I would not recommend to come early to the airport to spend time in the lounge.

 Hi everyone I've been accumulating miles mostly through spends/trips and I now have about 250k KF miles. Some miles will start to expire from May onwards progressively every month. So we have decided maybe it's time to utilise the miles. A quick check seem to indicate that the miles have gone up a fair bit since we made our last 2 redemption (Biz class tickets) and most trips we search have both legs on wait list as oppose to our previous redemptions where we had at least 1 leg confirmed. There's 2 adults and 1 toddler. We thought of redeeming tokyo for 2017 but was wondering if it's a good use of miles for a flight journey of 8 hours. I think at the back of our head we thought it might be good to use it for a location that is further out with travel time of say 10 hours or more? Understandably many destinations are still beyond our miles reach as we did think of London but the miles ask was too high and it's unlikely I would hit 400k+ miles by May before the miles starts expiring in small blocks. What are your thoughts on this if you were in my situation? Also would it make sense for me to buy a Economy ticket then use my miles to upgrade to Biz or just do full Biz upgade with the miles? thoughts and views appreciated! ,"['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5771616101264954, 0.42283838987350464]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Originally posted by EWR View Post thanks Keithmel for the reply Is there anyway to know what it would be mapped onto SQ before ticket purchase? I wouldn't want to buy the ticket if the SQ segments can't earn miss... Not sure. Is there a way you can put the OZ booking on hold prior to ticketing, eg book through a TA and enquire with SQ about the operating fare class prior to payment? OZ will also have this information but I highly doubt that you'd be able to retrieve it from their call centre staff. The marketing class will map to an operating class that is similar in the class hierarchy with the operating carrier, so chances are S class on OZ will map to something similar, but I'd recommend checking if you want to be 100% sure. BTW I'm assuming you're earning KrisFlyer miles given you've posted this in the KrisFlyer section? I just had a look at the KrisFlyer earn rates on SQ and it looks like most if not all of SQ's commercial classes do earn when accruing to KrisFlyer. So you'd most likely earn on the SQ sectors - only a matter of determining your earn rate. It's only really an issue if you're trying to accrue to a partner program as N/Q/T/V on SQ won't earn on a lot of their partner FFPs. Originally posted by EWR View Post I assume too that the OZ segments will remain accruable even if the SQ ones aren't? Yes, as earn works on a sector level so the eligible sectors will earn.

I booked a redemption booking online for myself & my fiancé (with me been the Kris flyer member using the miles, and my fiancé as the nominee). I didn't expect either of us to get any miles credited for the trip... and I confirmed this for my account - nothing showing up on my statement.

Apart from being extremely jealous, Im now wondering if I should say anything & see if I can get miles credited too, or just keep quiet and hope no-one notices the mistake. Is this a loophole in the system? Or just a lucky co-incidence? if you go into a store with your fiancee, and you both pay for something separately. both items cost $10. she pays first, handing the person a $10 bill. the cashier accidentally gives her back $10. you pay for your item and do not receive any change back. there are now three possible scenarios: 1. inform the person that your fiancee accidentally received $10 back. 2. keep your mouth shut and pocket the money. 3. inform the cashier that you are also deserving of the $10 back because of your winning smile and natural good charm. scenario 1 is the right thing to do. scenario 2 is what most people would do. scenario 3 is a precursor to a feature special on america's dumbest criminals.

Even though I'm no fan of the changes to PPS, I fail to see your point here. How is this any different than the old ""qualify via sectors"" system that we had previously? If you accumulated 50 sectors in the 12-month qualification period before, it's not like SQ gave you two years of PPS eligibility...they gave you one year, and at the requal time your qualifying sector count reset to 0. Yes, the currency has changed, and for most the bar has been set higher than it was previously, but I don't see any fundamental unfairness compared to the system before. Your extra PPS Value above $25K per year counts toward Solitaire status, just as your extra sectors above 25 counted for SPP in the past.

" Originally posted by 259850 View Post ANZ CSOs have not been consistent with answers, so I'll wait till they update their website. I'm not into collecting miles with credit cards as my leisure travel patterns don't optimize miles usage, but I use this card for all my spend except fuel, as it has a very generous cash rebate rate. The 1.4 miles per $1 converts to slightly over 2.5% cash rebate, double that for travel spend (which will go away, but still attractive), and a whopping 7.5% for grocery and EZ-link top-ups! I don't see how ANZ makes money on this card if I kept choosing cash rebates, as interchange fees are only around 2%. I had expected them to change the cash redemption ratios down, not the miles earning rate. Also the current 14k Travel$ monthly cap only applies to the double miles promotion....there doesn't seem to be any cap on regular spend. I just earned more than 15k Travel$ this month (which I promptly converted to cash). Today I'm told that for the ANZ Travel Card wef 11 July 2014, if you have a supplementary card, each main and supplementary card has their own S$10,000 cap to earn 1.4 Travel$ for every S$1 charged, meaning if you have a main card and 2 supplementary cards, your cap is S$30,000.

" Originally posted by barbene View Post Redeeming on the SIN-FRA-JFK route always seems a problem for saver awards. I have managed it once, but all other times I have been WL with ultimately no success at getting a ticket. You might want to consider, however, if redeeming on this route is really worthwhile. It is not, what I call, an ""intelligent use of airmiles"". Please consider - this route is served with one of SQs oldest planes (the 747). It is rather uncomfortable in Y, the screens are small and often have distorted pictures. For this SQ charge a large premium over other carriers. - you still have to pay the taxes and surcharges which are inexplicably in excess of S$600 (far more than other airlines) - you can pick up other *A tickets at a much cheaper cost than SQ. I recently booked a ticket SIN-NRT-EWR-PEK-SIN for similar dates to yours using UA from SIN-NRT, CO from NRT to EWR, CO again from EWR-PEK and then SQ from PEK-SIN. Travel time is identical, and the airticket was $1000 cheaper than SQ at S$1770 all in. I booked this via www.zuji.com.sg - if you consider that you would have to pay $600 taxes and US$480 to upgrade your points, the price difference is about S$520. For this you would use 68,000 of your precious airmiles. - My recommendation to you is to check out available fares using www.skyscanner.net and then see if it is really worth redeeming for this trip or to save your airmiles for something more financially better.

When I then use the website to upgrade, I was presented with UNRESTRICTED upgrade instead of Saver Y to J. Have I missed something ? I thought unrestricted applies for 77W and A380. In the future, how can I easily check if saver award is available? Thanks. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.8991018533706665, 0.10089816898107529]",krisflyer

But I would be very annoyed and force my way up to Suites - http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/...ry_506518.html Originally posted by Straits Times Downgraded despite confirmed booking I WAS booked on a Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore and had a confirmed booking in business class. On the day of departure, I checked in at London Heathrow Airport around three hours before boarding time and was given a business class boarding pass but no seat was assigned. I was told by the check-in staff that the flight was full but there was nothing to worry about and I should wait in the SIA lounge where I would be assigned a seat. However 10 minutes before boarding, I was told by the receptionist at the lounge that I would have to be downgraded to economy as the flight had been overbooked. Dismayed, I refused because I was confirmed in business class. However, I was told there were no other seats available and if I did not take up the economy seat, I would have to wait a few more hours in the airport for the next available flight. In the end, I had no choice but to take the economy seat as I was desperate to return to Singapore to see my family after my business trip in London. I am appalled at this bad service from one of the world's best airlines. I was told by the ground staff that this was not the first time this had happened with SIA and they always had to deal with angry customers like me. In fact, on the same flight, there was another passenger in the same situation as me. It is time SIA looked at its booking policy to prevent such incidents happening.

I'm looking at upgrading a booking from Economy to Business using points when I travel in May. Just want to make sure I've got this right, so if I book the fares as Flexi, and if I have enough points, I should then be able to login and use points to upgrade to Business. provided there are seats available for redemption. Can I do it for selected sectors of a booking? e.g. if I book SFO-ICN - ICN-SIN, can I do it just on the ICN-SIN sector or does it apply to the entire booking? Not sure about that. I think you can only select SFO-SIN or SIN-SFO if you are ticketed thru. I may be wrong here. Also how difficult is it to get Saver upgrades versus Standard and Full. I'm aware of the limitation of no Saver upgrades on 777-300ER or A380 (how silly). Hoping to get an upgrade on A330. How far in advance should the upgrades be requested? and do you find out straight away when you get them, or do they need to go for some sort of approval process. You should do so as soon as possible since seats are really limited for redemption. If you use points to upgrade, do you still earn points for that sector?

" Originally posted by VC10 Boy View Post I have always found daytime F flights more enjoyable as you are awake and can enjoy the experience. Overnight, no matter how much you try and stay up you invariably start to drift off and it's not as much fun. Of course once you have flown F a bit, overnights come into their own when you can actually ignore the service and just get a good night's rest. Yes, that's what I thought too. However, the general view (which I agree) that there is quite a difference between a Suite and First. So, to maximize the use of the same mileage, I hoping to get the Suite. Second reason being the day flight will arrive Frankfurt at night close to 9pm. So, it is basically paying additional night for the hotel stay. Don't think can do much on day 1. The night flight will arrive at about 7am. Good time to start day 1 trip. But I might have no choice as my night flight waitlist are still waitlist, while the day flight are wide open for most days.

And it got tedious after a while because we kept getting (unsubtly) steered back to that topic when we tried to discuss other aspects of the PPS program. Still, they do seem to be genuinely interested in making improvements to KrisFlyer. The Good: There might be more flexibility in the way miles can be redeemed.

" Just a quick question I hope - I have circa 4,500 miles expiring within the next three months and would like to extend them online. As a KF ""Elite"" Silver, it states that I can extend for 12 months, but that each batch of 10,000 miles costs 1,200 miles to extend - I was under the impression that one could pay cash to extend the miles, but was wondering if this is only open to KF Gold Elite and above? At least 4,500 minus 1,200 miles is better than losing them completely, but as a not particularly frequent flyer, every mile counts for me and I'd prefer to pay cash to extend Any advice gratefully received! Update: I've been playing round with the online mileage extension procedure and have a few more queries! When I select the next three months of expiring miles to extend, I'm presented with the following screen: The ""miles available"" boxes next to Jan/Feb/Mar are open to adjustment, i.e. I can easily increase the number of miles from 1,476 in Jan and this would be reflected in the total miles to extend shown at the bottom (above the email address box). My question is, if one can only extend up to three consecutive months’ worth of miles per transaction, why am I able to increase these values, and what implications might this have? As the service fee is 1,200 miles per 10,000 miles extended or part thereof, I'm wondering if I can simply increase the Jan/Feb/Mar totals to 3333, 3333, 3334 respectively in order to bring the total up to 10,000 and thereby extend miles expiring in latter months? Just wondering what experience others have had with online mileage extension? ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5189574956893921, 0.4810425043106079]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Originally posted by Bat69 View Post If you were on SQ12 at A5 gate Changi, you would understand why I said what I said. Even PPS & Solitire had to part the wall of Y pax to get to their priority queue. UA boarding at Narita was very organized when I flew UA late 2011, by row numbers for Y and it worked because the boarding staffs were efficient in getting people to avoid crowding the boarding lanes. SQ can't seems to be assertive enough in that respect, especially so with the new boading sequence for KF Gold. I'll reply taking your previous posts into account. Originally posted by Bat69 View Post On the same logic, why can't they maintain boarding from 'priority' lane for kf gold, but make the call for premium passengers to board ahead, so they would not have to 'wait too long' ? If QPP and TPP pax had to 'part the wall of Y pax', then it wouldn't have mattered if EG got access to business class lanes, right? Q/TPPs already did have priority lane access and still had to contend with impatient Y pax. The other posts in this thread indicate that ground staff at other airports / gates are better at enforcing the boarding sequence than those who were at Changi A5 (for SQ12 on the date that you travelled). That has been my experience as well. If you consider your NRT experience to be representative of the UA boarding experience overall, and priority boarding is a deciding factor in your airline choice, then it does make sense for you to move over to UA. My experiences with UA do not indicate that such orderliness is necessarily par for the course. YMMV.

" Hi everyone, I thought some of you might be interested to learn a bit more about the decision-making process that led to SIA's recent changes to the PPS Club. A very reliable source has shared with me an internal memo that outlines the company's new approach to ""loyalty marketing"". Some notable highlights are: The new qualification rules are expected to decrease the QPP and TPP population (currently at more than 45 000) by nearly 50%. Krisshop vouchers and birthday gifts for annual requalification were eliminated to help save the airline more than $5 million annually. Overall, with lower servicing costs due to cuts in benefits as well as the smaller number of PPS members, savings are projected to be between $15 and 20 million per year. Following the April announcement, SIA anticipated a sustained negative response from existing PPS Club members. It has hired additional staff and has formed a team (as the airline puts it) to communicate ""transparent and positive"" messages.

I recommend calling KF to check the availability of the upgrades for your desired flights/dates, as you might end up being waitlisted if you don't do so. In the booking engine, you may find a few fare classes, or perhaps just Flexi. From there you can see an outline of the fare rules (eg Date change, cancellation, upgradable). If you're going for a full fare ticket, go with Flexi (You may not have a choice, anyway). At the passenger details enter your KF number. AFTER you've made your booking, log into your KF account, and you should find that your booking is there.

On top of that then a PEY section, means a significant decrease in Y seats when an A359 takes over from a 772, but conversely a significant increase in the premium seats they need to fill.

" Relax guys. I work for neither company. It was a question off the top of my head and this is an internet discussion forum. Okay poor example earlier but there are partner lounges MH can use in T2 like the SATS lounge. I simply asked why these airlines would want to maintain lounges in each other's homebases instead of using an existing lounge.. Just a thought especially considering how SQ is so cost-conscious. When I flew SQ J from NRT I used the NH lounge since SQ doesn't have a Silverkris there. The NH lounge wasn't nice at all and barely offered any snacks beyond onigiri and a sandwitch. And that is a 6 hour flight.. plus it is an airport where SQ operates not just J but F cabins from. So with that perspective, why would they want to maintain a lounge in KLIA when they could use an existing one and not build a Silverkris in NRT (for example) to add to the earlier question. And thanks for the interrogative tone as if this were the court of law. A quick glance and the first two pages of the main thread reveals many threads full of question and rumour threads which are met with rational perspectives. Yet when I asked a question here I get flammed. I know a post I made 5 years ago had unwittingly offended a few but nice to know the grudges have been held so strongly so long.

" Originally posted by cowie View Post Can't you ask SQ to ticket the confirmed flight, while continuing to waitlist for your preferred flight? I believe date changes are free, or if it requires cancelling, redepositing, and reissuing, something ridiculously minimal like $20. Having said that, two extra days in Cape Town sounds wonderful. Yes that is possible. I think I just gotta do that, and hope for some reasonably early clearance. But quite frankly if the waitlist doesnt come in soon, I might be disinteested in it (the waitlist). This is partly because I am I am a planner, and I think it can be knarly if the waitlist clears 10 days out (as many have experienced). I will already have flown out on the outbound (its the inbound thats waitlisted) and I don't really look forward to the stress of trying to figure out last minute hotels, redoing the intineraries, and applying for more leave etc while at a game reserve. Another reason is I may not want to take the left over seats - imagine, next to the lavatories - if the flight is full. I called KF services again yesterday and foolishly asked where I was in the queue. Of course the agent didnt give an answer, but he said he could check for me whether there was seat availability. I said, yes please do that, but at the back of my mind, I was thinking, if there could be a situation of no seat availability, why did they let me waitlist? In any case, he came back from the hold and told me, ""I can see there's still availability, but it is not guaranteed. I will put the chance at 50-50"". I hesitated at his answer because if one peels it apart, it doesnt really mean much practically. He's just saying the flight is not full (well, we are 10 months out!), but SQ may or may not decide to release seats for awards. I haven't really dealt with this waitlist game before, because the last time I used KF was about 7 years ago (I just recently returned to it after ditching AC) and I recall seats then were much more readily available. I simply chose the dates with confirmed seating. Now, even though I thought I booked super early, almost all the dates were on waitlist, and the only available dates either left me with too short a holiday, or too long. Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining, and I understand SQ has every right to set up their programme as they like. These are just my reflections and thoughts over the last couple of weeks after running into multiple hurdles in the search process -- when I (naively) thought it would all be a breeze ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5569078326225281, 0.44309210777282715]",amenity_catering_lounges

" What are the acronyms you used ? IIRC, TPP ? The others I can more or less figure out. But, the fact that you have to achieve PPSV 25k in 12mths, means you have to actually take the trouble to calculate how much you have and make sure u just make 25k and not go over my too much, and defer trips to the following year. The burden of qualifying becomes the loyal passengers. This does not make sense at all, where the loyal passenger is doing all the work. Sounds like the COE, where we pay for a piece of paper entitling someone to own a car, and the tearing coupon for parking, where it becomes your responsibility to make sure you pay for parking, if not get fined, that is what SQ has turned into !! SQ also instituted a fine system, for SPPS in redeeming certificates. For example, you make a mistake in your online booking and need to change, it is either USD25 or loose 2500 miles for a mistake done online. SPPS used to have fees waived for everything. Not anymore.

" Originally posted by Anchen View Post Hi everyone, This is my first time here and I am also a newbie SQ Flyer and I apologize for asking some really silly questions here. I became a KrisFlyer member since April 2005 and haven't used it much since I do not travel that often unless my employer sends me overseas for some trainings or conferences. As of today, according to my last account statement, my current balance of KrisFlyer Miles is 10115 and Elite Miles is only 1100. The last time I flew and used my membership was in July last year for a short trip between CGK-SIN and SIN-CGK. This is how I earned my little Elite Miles above since I got 550 points from each leg. I will be attending an Australian conference this week and have a booking for CGK-SIN followed by SIN-SYD route. My question is, how many miles am I going to earn (roughly) from SIN-SYD (SQ220) route considering this is going to be like 6-7 hours flight or 6-7 times longer than a short CGK-SIN (SQ95X)which only lasts for 1 h 10 m. Out of curiosity, do we earn more Elite Miles by flying F or J than Y for the same route? Regards, Anton Hi, Welcome to SQTalk. You may use the below accural calculator to find out the number of miles you may accure on your KF. http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...rualCalcIn.jsp If flying Y, it will be 3912 miles. If flying J or F, it will be 125% and 150% of actual miles flown respectively. As for elite miles, I think J and F has higher elite miles than Y. Quoting from the SQ website: Please note: Elite miles refer to the actual miles flown, plus any applicable class bonuses earned. When flying on Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, class bonuses are awarded based on 100%, 125%, 150% and 160% of the actual distance travelled, in Economy Class, Business Class, First Class and the Singapore Airlines Suites respectively. On partner airlines, the Elite miles earned may differ. Miles earned through any tier bonus or promotional bonus do not qualify as Elite miles. No Elite miles are accrued for booking classes not eligible for miles accrual. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.881314754486084, 0.11868525296449661]",krisflyer

Even tomorrow, where there is plenty of J class availability shown on EF, there are no saver awards in J. It seems to me that KF are deliberately restricting saver awards. It would also seem that they would rather have an empty seat than allow someone to burn their miles using a saver award.

" Originally posted by CGK View Post It is not similar earn rate. Flying SQ C will get 1.5x on BD FFP, and SQ F will get only 2x (compare to 3x on LH M&M). Whoops my bad there. I was mistakenly thinking that both F and C get 2x on BD. However the BD award structure seems a bit more flexible than M+M, and they have Cash+Miles. So maybe similar or slightly better earn:burn ratio on BD?

" Hi Folks, A quick search provided some pointers but it'd be mighty helpful incase anyone could add any insights. I have a F-Saver redemption for myself (using SQ miles, I'm an SQ *G): SQ 2 HKG-SFO 30Apr08 confirmed SQ 1 SFO-HKG 11May08 waitlisted For the return leg, I see wide availability in the revenue F fare classes. My understanding is that SQ is likely to open up more award seats closer to the travel date for the return leg. Herein lies the quandry - my ticketing deadline is 25th April - what happens if another award seat doesn't open up by then? As per the Krisflyer call center, I could book my return leg for a date when there is a seat available and waitlist for my preferred date. However they pointed out that this entails a loss of the 15% online redemption discount (anyway of doing this online?). Any wagers on the likelihood of another O seat opening up before my ticketing deadline? Any way of extending my ticketing deadline? Should I wait a while (at the risk of losing other dates for which seats are available around my preferred date)? Any idea how many days before a flight are more seats released, if revenue bookings are low? ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.8743333220481873, 0.12566670775413513]",krisflyer

" HKG SilverKris Lounge Update (Aug 2019) I visited the SQ SilverKris Lounge yesterday before flying home on SQ1 HKG-SIN, after a short visit to Hong Kong this week. This was just a brief visit to Hong Kong -- in fact I spent all my time in Kowloon, and didn't head over to Hong Kong island itself, as all my business meetings were on the Kowloon side. I'll save my brief impressions of Hong Kong and the airport situation during these turbulent times for a subsequent TR, but thankfully I experienced minimal delays or hitches on my trip. I did visit the J section of the SQ SilverKris Lounge in Hong Kong, and here is a brief update on the lounge facilities and catering. Showers aside (Which are brand new), not a lot has changed since the lounge underwent a full refurb to the ""Home Away from Home"" concept in late 2014. Most significantly, the location remains a windowless location, in an airport where many other lounges are located in large airy atriums with beautiful airside views. On the positive side, the lounge is quite close to the SQ boarding gates, which makes it quite a convenient pitstop before the flight. Ironically, right above the SQ lounge are two beautiful lounges: The Qantas Hong Kong Lounge, and the new CX lounge ""The Deck"", both of which would have been great places for SQ to have a lounge.

" Hi kelvgoh Thanks again! Really appreciate your kind advice. Actually, I also want to clock the mileage into my ROP to requalify for *G status next year. At the moment, my friend and I have some KF miles which we thought will be good to use for some extra comfort on the flight. So far, I have checked the revenue booking class (C, D, J) and it seems that seats are still available. I will be on the 747. One more question, my friend and I have included our TG ROP number in the KF profile, any chance that if we do not provide the KF number at the time of booking and instead included my TG ROP number, would the system be ""smart"" enough to link it up so that I can upgrade online and save 15% mileage points?

Ok, fine, may be Citi Premier does the rounding better, but these DBS cards give out a lot of bonus points in return for their credit card fees (at more than half the rate to purchase miles from SQ). I may keep it just for the annual bonus and make sure I spend less than 25K on each. What's the reason for spending less than 25k? I tested out the DBS Altitude card with extreme spending last month and came away very, very impressed. So far day-to-day use is still seeing me use PremierMiles, but I may move more spend to DBS to ensure the 5,000 points threshold is met. Cutting up the DBS seems slightly silly at this point.

" Being devil's advocate slightly (no offence meant): Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post I did hold out for the few advantages of SQ *G: access to VS lounges; KrisShop-earned miles ; and last but amazingly not least, the affiliation with an airline whose ethos I'd grown to love. I assume you've also factored into your analysis the (much ?) greater availability for SQ awards/upgrades when using KF miles. Not only for the remaining 744 routes but also, if relevant, shorthaul redemptions from SIN. I've not heard of anyone who's willing to pay the ridiculously high 77W (and presumably A380) redemption rates but on the other hand, it seems that redemptions using miles from other programmes are (for the moment at least) unavailable ? Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post If I were to continue my flying days as an Elite Gold, I'd get no SIN SKL access; a segregated checkin counter at SIN; no more Fast Track access at LHR; miles that expire in 3 years but must be used at non-saver redemption levels for the 77W (and likely the A380); and no accelerated security line clearance at SIN (security lines are not a mandated *A privilege, so it should be possible for SQ EGs to get the privilege without extending it to *Gs). Of course apart from the mileage expiration/redemption points, you'd get none of these benefits if you banked with another FFP and made *G there. Unless I'm mistaken, it seems that your main gripes with SQ at the moment (leaving aside the increased redemption rates which don't affect ex-LHR for the moment) boil down to lack of soft touches from SQ UK (i.e. a calendar and invites to events) rather than anything (IMO) serious ? Whilst SQ's ground based service seems to be going down, this seems true of all airlines and I'd be surprised if CX isn't subject to the same intense competitive pressures as SQ. Perhaps a case of better the devil you know rather than switching your main FFP and finding out that things aren't always greener on the other side (or at least don't continue to be in the long term)!

" Originally posted by SQ747 View Post Not sure if this is well known or not, but I recently noticed that, as a KFEG member, I see far more available seats than a non-elite, when it comes to the actual seat selection. Clearly, like other carriers, they must be intentionally displaying some extra choices, but is there any basis for what seats the release? I know airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia make the more 'preferred' seats available for elites (i.e. the front few rows, exit rows etc.). Any idea if SQ has any method for their release of seats (obviously not preferred seats) or is it relatively random? Has anyone noticed differences in availability between KFEG, QPPS, TPPS and LPPS, or do they all seem to have an equal benefit over sub-KFEG? I do suspect so. Just did a little experiment on an existing booking to test this out. SIN-DPS in Y sometime in Nov. I'm QPPS. I can pick seats from the 3rd row onwards. Then I made a dummy booking on the same flight without logging in. Now my choices are restricted to the 6th row onwards. I have noticed this for a while. It appears by inference that TPPS/LPPS can pick any seat in Y, while QPPS gets rows 3-5, everybody else gets to choose rows 6-onwards. Then at x-number of hours before departure the entire seatmap opens up for everyone. Maybe other forum members holding TPPS, LPPS, KFEG status could test this theory out?

" Originally posted by florianwagner View Post I wonder if you could explain this statement to me. I somehow do not see a PR disaster/headache here, but a big management disaster. To me, PR could not have done anything to improve the situation ... except perhaps to inform the public a bit more. First, there is quite a difference between a 'headache' (the term SQfg used) and 'disaster'. Second, since SQ saw fit to try to spin the changes as enhancements that gave the PPS Club a more exclusive feel, when QPPs -- who are PPS members after all -- lost access to SKL F; QPPs/LPPs/TPPs lost access to the SKL when not on SQ; and requalification vouchers and birthday gifts were yanked away ... well, that decision turned this into a PR headache. The headache, as you pointed out, was caused by refusing to acknowledge that a bit more honesty and humility might have made the problem easier to manage. Loyal customers can be understanding if you explain why you have to make some hard choices and apologize for the impact on them. They might not be quite so understanding if you keep telling them that really, it's all for their own good, and you make them feel that you'll just wait for them to get around to seeing things from your vantage point.

" A year and a bit later... As it's been over a year since I qualified for TPP and started this thread, I thought it might be a good time for a brief retrospective. Here are my observations, in no particular order: Spouse card: obviously nice to have, and as I speculated earlier, it does remove the stress of maintaining status. Also useful for the extra luggage allowance. One interesting quirk, which I had not realized before, is that it is definitely not equivalent to full TPP status. Mrs. WBT maintains a separate status in her KF account (silver currently) but she does receive TPP benefits while traveling, and has a different designation on her boarding passes. Lounge access: generally nicer to be in the F lounge at SIN, but mostly for the wines, spirits and citrus-infused water (and less crowding). I think I actually may prefer the food in the business lounge as the F lounge is one level above my tolerance level for fanciness. I like the on-demand prata though. And roast goose in HKG! And the VS Clubhouse at JFK. Otherwise it's been the same lounges as before. Redemption priority: over the last year I've been cashing in a lot of miles for redemptions, and have managed to get close-to-ideal/desired flights. We now typically need three redemption tickets (plus one infant) so it has become harder. I did manage to get 3 Suites saver tickets to ZRH last summer, flying back from AMS in J. Also get PER return and MUC return in J, at saver rates (both times three). My strategy is to waitlist on multiple flights/dates/destinations and see what happens. So far, so good, but requires some flexibility in timing and potentially some positioning flights. Revenue waitlist priority: all waitlists I have been put on for revenue tickets in J have cleared, even ones that looked hopeless. Call center: in chasing waitlists for redemptions I have used the PPS Connect callback a lot, and in almost every instance the agents were good to excellent, mostly from the local call center. On-board recognition: not much noticeable difference. It all depends on the crew, and the IFS. That has more bearing on the service level than TPP. Priority luggage: usually OK at Changi, hit and miss elsewhere. Checking bags through from a JetBlue connecting flight to SQ 25 usually gets them re-tagged with shiny Solitaire tags at JFK, but not always. First class check-in at Changi T3: made a much bigger impact than expected! A surprisingly useful benefit that I didn't really expect to make much of a difference. I'm still glad I made it under the old system, and my reserve value after one year is already enough to keep me at TPP for a few years. Right now it's pretty easy for me maintain TPP but I would be flying SQ for the most part anyway. So far, so good!

" Originally posted by jhm View Post If that's the only obstruction to you joining BD and you don't earn huge amounts on PremierMiles, then IMHO this is a case of ""penny wise, pound foolish"". Look at the BD award chart here: https://www.flybmi.com/bmi/src/html/...pendmiles.html You can get a zone 7 (Singapore) to zone 1 (VIE) round trip redemption: 80,000 BD miles + £540 + taxes - F 60,000 BD miles + £405 + taxes - J And that's before certain optimisations you can make which can reduce the miles/cash cost consideraly (but require you to travel a bit more). One stopover allowed in each direction, e.g. you could redeem (say) SIN-BKK on SQ, stopover and then BKK to Europe on TG. Finally, you can buy up to 100,000 (IIRC) BD miles each year at a cost of approx. £250 for every 20,000 BD miles. Hilton stays ? 1,000 BD miles per night. BD also send you occasional offers, e.g. complete a 5-minute survey and get 2,500 BD miles! BD - a brilliant programme! I second that! If you are not going to be flying that much and mainly doing short haul flights and thus earning few miles, BD is your best option as the spending power is literally about 3 times better than most other *A FFP's. If you want to use your miles to get your wife out to SE asia every year and attain gold status then BD is the program for you! One of BD's amazing awards: Spain/Scandinavia/Italy ---> Hong Kong = 18,750 miles + £122.50 + taxes in J 25,000 miles + £170 +taxes in F You could earn gold and send your wife to SE asia return in F (for £550) every year!! It will still be a long time before BD would become M&M so use it while you can and then swap over to KF if the dreadful changeover happens ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.6937382817268372, 0.30626174807548523]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Hi everyone, I was doing a booking today for a multi-city flight: FRA-SIN-HGK-SIN-FRA. I got a specific price for an economy W ticket and just before payment the page told me I would earn an amount of miles equivalent to 50% of the actual flown miles (15,962). So I called SQ in FRA and asked them about it. They checked themselves and we found out there were, for exactly the same booking, same flights and same W category, 3 different prices: they got 2 different ones and I got a third one on my screen, with 3 different mile amounts. For safety, I let them do the booking so I am sure all the legs are in W and I get full mileage accredited. Only negative point, beside having to spend more then an hour with SQ in FRA on an international call, is that I could not reserve the specific seat & food I wanted... Anybody has been experiencing the same? Could it be due to the fact that one of the 4 legs was in a Q category or something?

She said SQ has never reprotected F class redemption to Suites - I told her this was total rubbish citing the upgauge change to A380 on SYD , NRT, LHR and now CDG flights. She said such pax would've been downgraded to J Class! Her colleague Vincent confirmed in a previous call that in fact such pax were reprotected to Suites.

I said sure I agree with that but an airline has the obligation to reprotect on: * a flight closest to the original departure time * in a cabin that is equal or better to the original one booked if such a cabin is offered * alternatively provide a full refund if these options are not possible or not suitable to the pax I was rebooked from First 77W leaving at 1750 to old First 744 leaving at 1130. ...she is now once again referring it to managment.

That being said, he also admitted that SQ's previous two announcements were that the lounge was opening at the end of October, then again at the end of November, so it's hard to say when the new lounge will be opening. SQ has lounge arrangements with the Plaza Premium Lounge in T2A. They seem to targeting this arrangement primarily to passengers flying in SQ317/SQ305. Passengers flying in SQ319/SQ321 are mostly suggested to go the the United Club or to the Maple Leaf Lounge. Passengers in Suites/First can also go to the United Global First Lounge. I made quick visits to the LH Senator Lounge, the AC Maple Leaf Lounge and the United Club. The United Club seems to be the largest, while the Maple Leaf Lounge is the smallest. Food seems to be the best at the Senator Lounge, which is catered by Do&Co. However, the Senator Lounge also seems to be the busiest (at least at this time). This might be because the LH Lounge is in T2A, where most of the short-haul gates are, and hence where most of the passenger traffic is.

We were then put on the 77W flight in F direct to SIN, but only after 4 hours of argument, and 900 dollars worth of roaming charges. But we claimed all back through insurance. It's a long story.

But I'm sitting in it right now, and typing from it too. And the first thing I did, after getting a water to dry out from the first sector, was sit down and login to SQtalk. Totally revamped. I showed my transit card and BP at the desk, thinking nothing afoot, and walked in, only to find myself totally plussed (ant. non-plussed) by the lounge, getting only a few feet before going back to the boy at the desk to inquire, ""I was here a week ago. This is totally different, right? I haven't lost my mind, have I?"" ""Yes, totally different. Please, come on in..."" So, the color scheme is very much like the new F, and the materials and such are like what you'd find at SIN T3. Somewhat oddly, there is still a front desk with two sides to pass through when entering, but both sides lead to the same room, which is a long deep room with computer terminals-- tons of them-- looking vaguely like a trading floor.

For additionaly seating areas, you can go fairly far to the left, and fairly far to the right, giving the whole thing a suggestion of caverns with no discernable end (Think, Indiana Jones, Episode III, catacombs of Venice scene, sans rats.) On the whole, I'd say it a marked improvement from the worn-out, wrung-out, tired old thing we all came to know, love, and hate whilst in transit on SQ 001/002. Still no ramp/airfield view. But one can't expect The World, can one? I have only an hour before my onward flight, but that's enough time to skulk about.

Before the change to SQ SIN-KUL flights, FC used to be one of the easiest FFPs in the world to get top tier status! As for BAEC, it depends on your circumstances, e.g. * 25,000 BA miles for an upgrade from WT+ to CW from LHR to anywhere in North America is a pretty good deal (plus availability tends to be quite good) particularly when you earn most of it back (even more so with the silver/gold 25/50% bonus). * For those based in the UK, BA's tie up with Tesco (and the Amex 241 vouchers) mean that with some planning it's enough to get enough miles for a trip for two each year to somewhere nice, e.g. I've done NRT (J) and NRT (F) in past years and have CPT (F) coming up next month. Some people in the past earnt enough to do that each year without even stepping foot on a plane! * Eurocheating and (before they were abolished) the BAH-DOH tier point runs etc means that it's pretty easy to get top tier status on BAEC.

Say you have 18k miles and short of 2k miles, if there are no credit card whose points that can be transferred if you are in Singapore, the only way is to fly or stay in hotels. ""Air Canada Aeroplan is better in this case. It is 30K miles in C for North to South Asia. And one can fly SQ.""

" Originally posted by WBT View Post I was wondering the same thing, and as I had to talk to SQ anyway I asked this question a few minutes ago. After some time on hold while the agent checked on this, he said that this was still under review and could not give me a definitive answer right now! That's... surprising? Not ideal? I guess we'll have to wait until they figure it out. One would have thought that they had nailed this down before announcing the changes... I do concur that not being able to waitlist anymore in the T-14 window would be a negative change, but then again, if they do allow it, what's to stop you from re-waitlisting immediately? That would undo the whole (supposed) point of the T-14 cutoff. I thought I'd follow up on this as I have recently been making redemption bookings again. Firstly, you can definitely still waitlist for flights on (very) short notice, as in departing tomorrow. Secondly, it may be the case that waitlisted flights within the T-14 window get confirmed quickly; this just happened to me to a T-13 flight which I'd waitlisted earlier today but I have only one observation thus far. I do have an active T-17 waitlist as well; we'll see what happens in a few days. Thirdly, if this is the case, I don't really see much difference with the old system. I'd be interested in hearing others' experiences with this... ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.6403123140335083, 0.3596877157688141]",amenity_catering_lounges

" To be honest, SQ's cabin crew behaviour is nowadays not as good as back then. And I agree with the conversation in galley, conducted in other languages than english (i.e. Chinese mandarin), becaming quite a nuisance. I am a frequent occupier of seat 57A/K. Some do stand-out, but most of them especially the ones in CGK flights, need the issue to be addressed. On long haul flights, it is slightly better, though still overall it went downhill. My mother, recently took business class LHR-SIN. The first meal went smoothly, but the second meal, after being asked what she wanted to eat, the meal was never served (she noticed the desserts were already served. Complained directly, and she was offered the meal, but she said she did not want to eat now as it was near to landing. So was offered $75 as compensation. A mere $75 for a business class meal. As comparison, back in SQ's golden days it was $50 for non-operational IFE in economy class. My family was a loyal SQ passenger since year 2000s (all of our international flights were SQ - and my parents were PPS, with relation manager back then), but now we still fly SQ, albeit not as frequent though still more often than other airlines combined. I especially love ANA (business) and Asiana as SQ's alternative and will be trying Thai (business) and Eva soon. These experiences were/will be eye opener for me.

" Originally posted by jhm View Post Maybe SQ needs to differentiate PPS depending on where a person is based ? Higher levels for those based in SEA ? Actually, from what I've seen and heard (just my experience), those on the long-haul (e.g., the kangaroo route) routes are most likely to have companies that are willing to splash out on business class to make sure their employees are productive when they arrive at weird hours (based on their home time zones). Does this mean they should be hit by higher requirements because of their or their employers' concern for productivity? Just my personal POV, but it isn't nice to take away such perks, because it isn't as though road warriors don't pay the price for that kind of travel. A similar comment goes for those who shell out their own money to make travels more comfortable. What I'd like to see not happen, at the very least, is the sort of BA Eurocheat levels for top elite (in this case, PPS) membership, such that a member who isn't in a captive market gets highly favorable qualification terms. The extent of such a bifurcation in qualification requirements would, IMO, be unfair to those who at the home city or near enough. (I do realize that we're all speculating in the absence of an announcement or of a desire by CGK to reveal fully what he knows, whispers or not . It seems to me that the best solution is not to have such drastic changes in the program to start with. FWIW, drastic increases in PPS qualification requirements will definitely diminish my reasons to fly with SQ.)

I have gotten access with my LH miles to flights on 345, 77W and A380 - all 'new' business class. No other airline used to have this access. BD, now fully owned by LH, seems to recently have gotten access to the LH inventory (maybe they put their IT together or using the same booking platform now) and I booked a flight on a 77W to NRT and was offered seats for a trip to ZRH on the A380 - both 'new' business class. UA redemptions on any 'new' business class would be a glitch, there is nothing that has changed for any other *A partner to my knowledge as of now. What continues and is very annoying is that sometimes there is *A availability in Y and J but no saver inventory for PPS/KF. Could I ask the following two questions? 1) How far in advance did you see availability on the ZRH-SIN route and also was it hard to find a date with availability or was there quite a bit of availability? 2) You say that you think BD may be using the same award booking platform now.

My target is always to get Gold and Lounge Access but my wife benefits a lot from my miles to fly between SG and HK so even the AsiaMiles i have are useful for that - can't remember the last time i used my miles for myself Assigning credit card points to KF helps my mileage accural but if i go for ROP then i send them to AsiaMiles instead. The bonus vouchers etc. that UA offer are useless for us so the quicker i can get into a more useful program the better, more so since i never go to the US.

" Another vote for the LHR flights. Not only excellent catering, but excellent crews as well. Seems like SQ really takes an extra step on this route. For SIN-LHR I usually go with SQ320 or SQ322 depending on how schedule works for me. If I am on leisure or in no need of a rush for meetings, I would go for SQ320. This flight IMO has the most comprehensive meal service of all the long haul sectors. I've always felt I've gained extra weight after taking this flight with a heavy lunch after takeoff and a heavy dinner before landing. Plus it arrives into town just in time for bed and a fresh day the following morning. If I am in a rush and can't sacrifice an extra day of flying, SQ322 works the best for me. Gets me into London early in the morning where I can check into my hotel and take a brief nap 8-8:30 am and be ready for my meeting or appointment. And yes I do love the SQ the fresh egg breakfast which I get on SQ322. Though I have to admit it feels awkward to be eating breakfast at 3 or 4 am UK time. And often this flight arrives (sometimes the 1st flight to arrive morning into LHR) very early that Fast Track is not opened yet and my eyes would still be in GAGA mode by the time I get out. SQ308 IMO is the worst of the 3 flights in terms of timing. Taking this flight means waking up at OMG hours for departure and by the time you arrive into LHR, its only 3PM and you still have another 7 hours to burn and stay awake. On LHR-SIN, without a doubt my favorite is SQ319. Full dinner service after takeoff with great variety of choices and quality and just in time for the pampering of turn down service for bed afterwards. Wake up for breakfast and a smooth early afternoon arrival. I've taken this flight already 3 times this year for the eastbound Kangaroo route (twice connecting to AKL, once connecting to SYD). Even though SQ321 is the flight that is suppose to connect immediately to SQ285 or SQ221, I've always used SQ319 to connect to these flights and don't mind the long layover in SIN. Gives me the opportunity to sleep & swim at the transit hotel and take care of my paper work inside the SKL for 6-7 hours. As a matter of fact will be using SQ319 again to connect to SQ285 on the return trip this month. IMO the meals on SQ321 is not as comprehensive as 319 and certainly feels strange to depart LHR at night, sleep and then wake up to realize it's near evening in SIN and certainly makes it difficult to sleep again on the following sector to Aus/NZ. I've never taken SQ317 and have no intentions in doing so anytime soon. This is by far the worst flight timing among the 3 LHR-SIN. Too early to sleep with the noon departure and then by the time you are tired, it is almost time to land into SIN EARLY MORNING. So my order of preference top to bottom from most preferable to least would be: SIN-LHR: 1) SQ320 2) SQ322 3) SQ308 (avoid if possible) LHR-SIN: 1) SQ319 2) SQ321 3) SQ317 (avoid if possible) Just a note from my experience that satay is served on SQ320 (Dinner)/319 (Dinner) but not on SQ322/321. As stated earlier, never taken 308/317 and have no idea if satay is available for these flights. Also in addition to the LHR flights, I have fallen in love with SQ286/285 operating the AKL sectors. Like SQ320, SQ286 is a daytime flight with nice meal offerings - light lunch after takeoff and full dinner (satay included) prior to landing. This 10.5 hour sector gives pax just enough time to get a feel of what F class is like by staying awake for most of the flight. On the return, SQ285 IMO is much better than SQ221 to SYD because the extra long hours of flying gives me just the amount of time needed to sleep in regular duration whereas SQ221 is just way to short to catch sufficient amount of rest. If one is flying SIN-SYD I would instead advice them to take the daytime flight SQ219 and avoid the later two overnight flights as there is just not enough flying time to get a descent amount of sleep.

I missed this before! Jut to clarify. SQ did not launch the Suites because the new 77W F seats didn't 'hit the mark' The Suites were ready a couple of years before they were launched, and were supposed to be revealed during a singing dancing flagship launch of the A380, which would have also revealed the lflat bed JCL at the same time. Unfortunately the A380 delays put paid to this so they were forced to reveal the new J and the 77W F when SQ got the first 77W. They had to keep the Suites under wraps until the A380 was ready.

" TPP Birthday Upgrade &amp; PPS Rewards Stand-By Upgrade execution I was fortunate enough to score a Birthday upgrade (from J to F) for quite a long flight (SIN-LAX) recently. I don't make it a point to travel on or around my birthday to score the upgrade, and the last time I travelled on SQ one day before my birthday I was already in F. So I was curious of how it works. Having checked in at CGK airport (my route was CGK-SIN-LAX), I finally got my SIN-LAX upgrade to F only at boarding time in SIN. Even though I am thankful SQ is doing this, wouldn't it be nice to just award the upgrade at check in at CGK? After all, the F seat SIN-LAX was available at check in (yes, I was monitoring the flight loads with ExpertFlyer). Giving away the upgrade at last minute during boarding seems a bit petty in my opinion. After all, how many TPPs travels on their birthday really? Frankly I don't know if my experience was the standard, or an anomaly. Can anyone else share their experience? Is the birthday upgrade given at check in at origin airport? Or at gate? Now I have a couple of standby upgrades (part of PPS rewards) to be used on my future flights. T & C is as follows (bold emphasis mine): Terms and conditions PPS Rewards are valid for 12 months from the date of issue. Standby Upgrade applications must be submitted at least 48 hours before your flight. Upgrades are not guaranteed upon application of the PPS Reward, and are subject to seat availability upon check-in at the airport. This PPS Reward may be used by the principal PPS Club member or their redemption nominee. Each Upgrade Reward can only be used for one traveller, per flight segment. This PPS Reward may be combined with a Double KrisFlyer Miles Reward. Check terms and conditions for Double KrisFlyer Miles Reward. This PPS Reward can only be used if the original commercial booking is in the following classes: Economy class - Y, B, E, M, H, W; Premium Economy Class - S, T; Business Class - Z, C, J, U. Standby Upgrades can only be used for upgrades on flights operated and marketed by Singapore Airlines or SilkAir. This excludes codeshare flights marketed by Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, and operated by codeshare partners, as well as codeshare flights marketed by codeshare partners, and operated by Singapore Airlines or SilkAir. Only one Standby Upgrade can be used for one flight segment, and is applicable only for one-cabin class upgrades. This means that two Standby Upgrades cannot be used in conjunction for a double upgrade (e.g. from Economy Class to First Class, or Economy Class to Business Class, on an aircraft that offers Premium Economy Class). The PPS Reward cannot be combined with a redemption ticket (including HighFlyer) or with a redemption upgrade. This PPS Reward cannot be combined with mySQupgrade. KrisFlyer terms and conditions apply. I am curious to see how this works as well. Wait until last minute unsold seats? Or really upgrade at check-in as per the T & C? Would appreciate any sharing of your experience as well. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.6638165712356567, 0.33618345856666565]",krisflyer

" Travel @ AsiaOne Flight cancelled: passenger vents anger on SIA staff Woman claims that she is a PPS Club member and demands that ground staff place her on a flight. She threatens the staff with losing their jobs should they not do so. -AsiaOne Fri, Jul 24, 2009 AsiaOne By AsiaOne While most people would be understandably upset should their flights be delayed or cancelled, how far would one go to vent and frustration caused by the situation? For a female passenger scheduled to board an SIA flight, it seems that one could go as far as to threaten the airline's ground staff with losing their jobs. In a 40-second video upload onto a video-sharing site, a woman was seen to be yelling at some SIA ground staff members. According to a reader contribution on citizen journalism site STOMP, the incident happened sometime in July at the Kular Lumpur International Airport. The Singapore Airlines flight SQ117 was delayed, causing passengers to be upset. Things got worse when the flight was eventually cancelled, according to the STOMP report. The irate woman was seen in the video shouting at the ground staff, emphasizing her status as a PPS Club member. The PPS Club is an SIA membership program that is a grade above that of Krisflyer members. In the duration of the video, the woman could he heard asking the ground staff if they are ""insane"" and if that was the way they treated PPS Club members. She demanded the staff put her on a flight because of her membership status. When the SIA staff members asked her to calm down, she shouted, ""Do you know this can cost you your jobs?""

" Originally posted by taipeiflyer View Post Dear SQFAN, I disagree with CGK's interpretation. I believe Scenario A works just fine. There is the clause ""five consecutive years."" However, that is directly preceded by ""within."" Were this to say 250,000 and 5 consecutive years PPS, then you would be restricted in achieving PPS until a five year period had passed. However, this is not the case. It is merely saying that you have 5 years to reach that threshold, and in the event you are unable to do so, you do not reap the benefits of solitaire. The closest analogy i can consider is paying a car loan on a 0% interest period. As long as you pay back the car within, say, 24 months, you are fine.... you don't have to wait until 24 months have passed to gain title to the car if you have paid it back within 4 months. Once you have reached the 250,000SGD threshold, you are eligible to receive the benefits of solitaire status- as long as that threshold did not take LONGER than 5 years to achieve. Just received confirmation from SQ regarding Scenario A. My initial thoughts were correct- here is the answer i was just given: ""Regarding to your question, you may upgrade to Soliter PPS status if you get SGD 250,000 requirement in 2 or 3 years. Continuous 5 years is maximum duration. I hope it is clear for you."" Hope this clears up any confusion for anyone.

I was ""gifted"" Marco Polo Diamond through my credit card, so I thgouth I'd give it a test drive (their marketing worked this time!). Since I received the Diamond benefit, I've flown CX on around 20 sectors, and am absolutely loving it. The overall experience may not be quite up to SQ standards although they do have some positives, but their treatment of premium flyers in my mind is far superior to SQ. This ranges from: - acknowledgement on board EVERY time I fly (and they are genuine about it), including a few times a little note on my seat welcoming me on board - on the 80 or so SQ sectors in the past year in Y and J I've been acknowledged and greeted perhaps 10 times - OW F lounge access in any airport - The occasional upgrade - although I never expect this, so not as big a deal but still nice. Given qualifying for diamond is no where near as onerous as a QPP (let alone TPP) for me since I don't always fly J or F, this in itself is a huge differentiator. Oh and to top it off, when submitting an expense claim for misplaced baggage with SQ, I was always addressed with a completely different first name in written communications - so much for ""highly personalised"" service as a QPP. Anyway, to the point of my post - based on the above I'm ready to switch to CX full time, and fly SQ only when required (still more convenient for SE Asia connections). Is it worthwhile me providing the above feedback to SQ and tell them I'm leaving? I don't necessarily want anything from them; my mind is made up, but I would hope that feedback in this business is something they take seriously and hopefully act upon.

" Originally posted by SMK77 View Post LX gave out amenity kits in F for the hop from BKK to SIN - with the fantastic LaPrairie lip balm... It is just pathetic coming up with non-sense rules as to when you can hand out amenity kits or not. Most of the current Ferragamo kits is pretty bad stuff anyway so I am not really bothered - but it doesn't match the F experience telling pax that they meet the general rule but this particular flight is excluded from the rule. More pathetic is that SQ is still flying around the regional F product and not telling anyone that it is around. SIN-MEL with ueber-F (Suites), 77W F and regional F is an example for pretty bad management decisions. Needless to say that on SIN-MEL they are using the regional F for the overnight flight... I would agree on the quality of the items in the Ferragamo kits - only the fragrance/Eau de Toilette is of decent quality, the face mist is okay, but the hand cream & lip balm are junk. I wish SQ will go more like BA F kits. On some flights getting amenity kits and some don't, it is quite reasonable and non non-sense in my opinion - and it IS the industry practice in general. Only on some Europe-Asia tag on flights on LH/LX etc. can you get amenity kits on short haul flights in J & F, and it is not consistently practiced from what I see. On SIN-MEL F mixed product-vaganza: I hope it is just a transitional period with deliveries & retirements & redeployment of aircraft. It can indeed be frustrating to buy an F ticket on SQ knowing that you may end up getting the older / (much) less desirable product should you need to change your schedule, or if flight disruptions occur.

" Originally posted by taipeiflyer View Post hi DFP... i know this is a vague answer, but i would say ""it depends."" it depends on: 1. how long you have been a PPS member? 2. are you nearing solitaire status? 3. do you foresee several trips in future years on SQ metal that would justify spending the $1500SGD this year, to continue working towards solitaire? 4. has SQ axed a route (i.e., me with TPE-LAX) or added a route (Houston-Moscow) that would make your future travels either more difficult, or easier, which would factor in to how you can spend the $1500SGD? 5. would you consider picking up a ex-US rtw, knowing that your first leg will net you the 1500SGD, and you wouldn't feel like it was just to chase PPS, because you still have future travels to look forward to? after weighing those factors, i think the answer will probably be pretty easy for you. as for myself, i do NOT think PPS is worth it, especially if you fly J or F a lot (which obviously you do if you have accumulated 23,500SGD in PPS value in this year alone. that being said, if it was me, i would chase it, because i am very close to solitaire status (and know that if i were to lapse, i would never approach it again). in my first year of PPS membership (last year), i earned 187,000 in PPS value. I know that i would never even come close to approaching that level again (especially considering the axeing of my most flown route) and considering the fact that i didn't pay anywhere close to 187,000SGD to SQ, but achieved that amount thru the sector conversion, so to lapse at this point would basically be a waste (especially considering i had other viable options (like BR), available to me at a significant savings. with my travels this year, i should be able to hit solitaire by the end of the year. but after that, i will only seek my 25,000SGD every other year, and bounce back and forth between PPS and Solitaire. with other carriers (like NH), stepping up their product big-time, i don't even think SQ is the best in the sky anymore. if i had barely crossed the 25,000 last year, and i was still short this year (even by 50SGD), i would not waste the additional time and money to chase it. after all, they wanted to cull the PPS ranks... they sure are getting what they asked for. we, as flyers, should go back to making them chase us (and our hard-earned money), not us chasing an exclusive ""club"" that is really just a figment of our imaginations. with the economic condition worsening, and travelers focusing ever more on cost, it is only a matter of time. good luck DFP in whatever you decide! hope all of your travels, whether on SQ or another carrier, are pleasant, and you get the respect that a person who flies as much as you is deserving of. Well said Taipeiflyer. The way SQ is moving is that is now easier for us to consider other airlines. The only main goal for me is whether to go for Solitaire or not. The price of getting that status is an expensive one. I estimated I will save about 40% flying with other airlines' premium cabins and that savings will go a long way to get a new car or have a nicer holiday or enriching the lifes of the less fortunates.

They never did. Second person told me it would be 103,000 miles extra and that the ticket would need to be re-issued. Third person said that it couldn't be done by topping up miles and the whole return award would need to be cancelled and re-booked, however the (now) expired KF miles used to book the award would not be refunded due to them expiring. I think you're right, I'll probably call one more time and ask to talk to a supervisor so I can get a definitive answer. It seems like if the ticket needs re-issuing that would involve the cancellation of at least the return leg of the current award and if that meant the miles not being refunded, it wouldn't be a worthwhile exercise. But hopefully a supervisor can at least give me a firm answer. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.6502447128295898, 0.3497552275657654]",krisflyer

If you have a travelling partner who doesn't have status, is merging the two bookings required so that they can check in, join priority queues and board early with you?

I'm inclined to think since i am an existing/old member, i will need another 50K elite miles (of which i currently have none!)... B. Wondering if i'll be able to appeal to SQ for a show of some good ol' SQ love so that I will be able to attain EG by the end of my next SFO-SIN in Sept (or at least when I do SIN-SFO-SIN again later in October) since all but the initial 5k miles would have been earned through this year (since Jan 08)? Thanks for all your feedback on this thread. i've been following it and have found it very valuable. I find myself currently in a similar position as INIX in that perhaps I shoulve just discarded my old account, gotten myself a new one and achieve EG without the extra 25k elite miles i now require...

Notice that they announce SQ flight boarding, but when reaching the gate, they just started the boarding for pax in Y holding B zone. Yup, all the J pax were seated already when I boarded.

Reply: No preferred airlines but recently been flying lots of MH within Asia due to the cheap fares.

Since my long haul flight would be IAD (20k miles), was considering to bank into OZ in the long term. I would fly to IAD once a year or once every 2 years. Or bank those miles to SQ instead? OZ would be easier to maintain status since their re-qualification period is every 2 membership years. If going with OZ, I would fly to JFK then connect to IAD via Delta.

" Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post This is a bit of a grey area to be honest. If you have an F ticket and on the same ticket flying onwards in JCL on a flight with no F, you can get in TPR. I have done this on a number of flights to BKK and SGN in the last 12 months when I was inbound in F. I have even got access when arriving in F (Suites) and onwards on a sperate ticket in J by showing the Gold BP. Having said that, I don't think the White Ladies themselves are sure of the rules. In January three of us were on the last schedued 744 pax flight from Europe (SQ25 from FRA on 16 Jan) in F. Of the three I was onwards in J to BNE, another was flying to CGK in F and another to PER in J. The F ticket to CGK obviously got access to TPR, I also did with my F BP from FRA but the pax flying to PER was refused entry. The only difference was the PER pax was not Solitaire, but as TPP is not a criteria for entry, apparently, it made no sense. We instead went to the F lounge and then when the PER pax left to get her flight the two of us went back to TPR and I again got entry with my F BP. The rules of entering the TPR are rather inconsistent. A month ago, I posted here when passenger A (TPP) flying in F/R guested passenger B flying in J/Y. The whole incident was handled with a complete lack of discretion. Both pax originated from SIN. A came in first and started talking to the waiters about how the receptionists are being ""very sticky with entry rules"". He then proceeded to order drinks and meals for 2 people and told the waiter to deliver it to the table at the FCL where he will have it with B. He then left the TPR. Five minutes later, A returned and took his seat. He was joined by B moments after, complete with plates and cutlery from the FCL area. Heard every word they said and they did not make an effort to keep their voices down when thanking the TPR supervisor for the ""exception"" granted to them. When I raised the anomaly to another TPR staff when leaving, the lady was dumbfounded and merely blinked a couple of times at me. I didn't ask any more as the buggy driver was waiting for me.

" Originally posted by sabian View Post Maybe the way tickets are being sold should be refined? If you hand over good money for a seat, unless the plane is grounded, most would expect the ticket to do what it says. It seems as though the airlines are dumping the risks of overbooking squarely on the laps of the passengers (esp if you have no status). I am learning more about flying since joining this forum. I agreed that it is not good dumping passengers but it is also the way the industry is structured. There are also difficult or not so difficult passengers who did not turned up or do quite last minute changes and the airlines will be faced with not filling up their seats. I been on a flight to PVG where it was supposed to be filled to the brim when I checked in but in the end some 6 passengers did not turned up and this is in Business Class. That is equivalent to about SGD 18K loss in revenue carrying capacity. Probably statistics will tell us that for every flight there are some passengers not turning up for a variety of reasons. The advantages of some overbooking could potentially be: A. Lower airfare as airlines are not faced with the possibility of losing revenue capacity. B. Upgrading of passengers to higher premium class that most of us looked forward to. Not sure if status will determine the standing of the passenger in getting the seat.

 Some responses for Wally. If you are based in SIN then it will be unlikely that your employer will put you on MH flights since they hub out out of KUL - it will add hours of travelling to every trip. They might get you to drive over to JB occasionally to get flights to East Malaysia. Traveling in whY with SQ as a KFGold or StarAGold can be a bit frustrating as the SQ program is heavily focused on their PPS folk. As a KFGold you get not much more than would if you are StarAGold with TG or UA. The SQ website fares tend to be the cheapest possible with many conditions and no flexibility.

" I'm not sure it's always that cut-and-dry about fare class vs. status. I can see an argument for the other side. My current high-revenue loyalty may be assured if an airline can signal that it will treat me well in the future, even if my circumstances don't allow me to generate revenue at the same rate. This logic, I think, explains why LH has the Business lounges for business class passengers and the SEN lounges for the frequent flyers who may be flying in discount economy. To be more SQ-centric: that a TPP (especially after the post-Aug 31 rules) who flies in Y gets access to a better lounge than a J class passenger is, IMO, good business practice. zvezda's F passenger is one case where I do see fare class trumping status.

Of course CX only serves 1 champagne Krug in F and SQ , 2. I don't know... All I do know is CX's Lynch Bages is famously popular. I stilll have a bottle of '92 somewhere courtesy of an empty CX F flight a few years ago! Haven't got enough experience in F to speak about the wines. From memory, CX served William Deutz Cuvee on some routes and Krug on others. SQ serves both DP and Krug long haul, and only DP on the shorter regional routes. CX wines can be rather hit/miss in J though, SQ whilst predictable is rather dependable. As for the fizz I find it pretty bizarre how CX serves the v delicious party in a mouth, Billecart-Salmon NV (seriously, I'd drink this over DP!!) on its regional routes other than NRT yet offer the paint stripper Champagne Deutz on its long hauls plus NRT! I do realise these things are YMMV but Deutz has been massively unpopular with everyone I've spoken to, even the most ardent CX fans. Surely you'd want to serve the good stuff on your premier routes. SQ serves Charles Heidsieck Mis En Cave which is pretty good as far as NVs go though some of the disgorgements can be rather 'green.' For the best onboard wine list though - I find LH truly a class act in F! And NZ and QF rather solid in J when it comes to the reds and whites, with NZ and CX regional coming out tops for J fizz with the Laurent Perrier NV and Billecart respectively. YMMV of course.

" Originally posted by KeithMEL View Post Not sure. Is there a way you can put the OZ booking on hold prior to ticketing, eg book through a TA and enquire with SQ about the operating fare class prior to payment? OZ will also have this information but I highly doubt that you'd be able to retrieve it from their call centre staff. The marketing class will map to an operating class that is similar in the class hierarchy with the operating carrier, so chances are S class on OZ will map to something similar, but I'd recommend checking if you want to be 100% sure. BTW I'm assuming you're earning KrisFlyer miles given you've posted this in the KrisFlyer section? I just had a look at the KrisFlyer earn rates on SQ and it looks like most if not all of SQ's commercial classes do earn when accruing to KrisFlyer. So you'd most likely earn on the SQ sectors - only a matter of determining your earn rate. It's only really an issue if you're trying to accrue to a partner program as N/Q/T/V on SQ won't earn on a lot of their partner FFPs. Yes, as earn works on a sector level so the eligible sectors will earn. So, after a lot of time thinking about this - and the recent incident at SFO - I finally decided to go with LX. It's a mix of booking classes L (outbound) and S (inbound). Can I just confirm that I will earn miles for the S class booking, even though L is more restrictive? Expedia.com.sg said something like the most restrictive rules would apply, but there's nothing said about mileage in those rules. I have checked SQ, AC and many other *A FFPs accept S class on LX...

" So in my latest attempt to procrastinate, I have been thinking about some SQ Flights coming up in December, ex-HKG and ex-SIN. I have decided to BTC on 2 of the flights, and eat off the regular menu for the other flights. As an infrequent SQ Flyer, that'd give me a taste of both regular SQ F dining, as well as F BTC. I have confirmed the Chilean sea bass out of HKG as it's one of my fave things to eat (on the ground), and the one out of HKG doesn't have shellfish ingredients cf ex-SIN which has a bouillaise sauce. I am then undecided between the Kyo Kaiseiki or the Rack of Lamb ex-SIN. Some Qs for the experts: - Is it true that the lamb appears regularly on the onboard menu (i'm flying SIN-MEL), in which case rendering it pointless to BTC? I think I read this somewhere on TOF but I can't find the actual post now. - Does the Kyo Kaiseiki meal contain shellfish? I couldn't tell from the pictures. - I can't find any menu for SQ211, which is the seasonal 4th frequency to MEL. Is that a breakfast or lunch flight? It departs at 1045. If breakfast I suppose I'd have to find another ex-SIN flight to BTC on as the choices for breakfast on the BTC menu don't seem too appealing. Any advice is appreciated, as always.

" Hi I have just booked a Star Alliance round the world award in J using my KF points. Prior to booking, I was really worried I wouldn't be able to get the seats I wanted, so I have booked a bunch of dummy dates for all segments except the first. Routing is SIN-BKK-VIE//FRA-xYUL-MCO//SEA-xNRT-PVG-SIN (will add an intra-US leg once some seats are available). I wanted to get advice on the way the service fees for change of date/route/carrier are applied. I have looked at the info at https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/u.../service-fees/, but can't work out if I will need to pay US$20 for each sector that I change in a single 'transaction' or just one lot of US$20 per 'transaction'. Given all but the first segment will need to be changed (and I'll be keen to lock in seats from the first date they are available to book, which will mean repeated changes for some, especially the latter, sectors), I am hoping it's just one fee per transaction, regardless of how many changes I make. Any advice please? Thanks Geoff. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5272459387779236, 0.47275403141975403]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post That sticky covers mainly alternatives to KF when continuing to fly on SQ or other *A members... Originally posted by SQflyer View Post Thanks everyone for the advice! and i in response to HugeAL i did check the sticky already. im now leaning towards ANA despite the early afternoon departure and the somewhat less desirable regional C seats between NRT-SIN and the not so fun overnight return in those seats from SIN-NRT as I am not able to find any cheap C class fares on BA/QF to SIN. OK, NOW we're definitely on the topic of the sticky. If you're ""leaning towards ANA"" (or any carrier for that matter) you do not have to credit your mileage directly to that carrier. True, some additional benefits can be had while flying your host FFP. ANA has an OK program and does treat their Diamonds pretty well. Qualification must include 50k EQMs on NH metal. Upgrades using Diamond Certificates/Points are almost always granted (I don't know of any Diamonds who didn't get their upgrade), but the burn ratio utilizing miles sucks. Being a Japanese carrier, the service level given to NH Diamonds is excellent and much more rewarding than PPS -- but then again, most things are more rewarding than PPS. Net/Net: if you're planning on flying NH, check out the sticky and go with the *A program that best fits your needs. jjpb3, NOW if OP definitely goes with NH or a *A carrier, can we merge this?

" I've discussed with StarG about this issue a while ago, since this rumor has been circulating underground for a while already... but I've come to the following likely scenarios which I think SQ will do to change PPS: 1st one, which I personally think is most likely and makes the most sense, is that SQ would not change PPS Club as it is right now, but instead add a new unpublished tier like UA UGS or CX Diamond Plus program. However, this would eventually devalue PPS to the point that it'll become useless, like UA 1K. The benefit of doing this is that SQ will not upset too many of its existing customers (the ones who don't surf online looking for FF information all the time), as they would have no idea the new tier exists (you'd be surprised at how many UA mileage plus members have no clue that UGS exists). The benefit though is that they can focus more resources on this new group of people. The other benefit is that they would not need to publish a guideline on how this new super elite tier will be calculated and just say that it is by invitation only, and limit the number of people as they see fit (UA limits it to the top % of fliers by country and the $ amount varies year to year). This would also make sense of get rid of LPPS, as existing LLPS members would probably get lifetime status in this super tier.. 2nd scenario would be that they might change it so that people in certain countries require more sectors to requalify. SIN and CGK based members might require 50 sectors to qualify, whereas other countries will remain at 25. This would be similar to what LH and BA does, which give different requirements depending on where you live. However, one concern will be people who change their address to bypass this, although I don't think it will be too many people outside of SQT, FT, etc.. Last scenario would be that they overhaul PPS completely using a revenue based system as talked about here by this thread. There will however be significant challenges in doing this. SQ will need to disclose how they calculate the revenue so that existing PPS members in order to minimize confusion. As mentioned, it will be difficult for SQ to calculate non SQ stock ticket revenue, RTW tickets, etc. Calculating ticket revenue is a black art that usually only airline account departments can decipher and there will be countless people who will complain that they were shortchanged by SQ, etc.. A lot of frequent travellers who fly on short haul routes will also not make the cut, and someone who only flies one F class roundtrip from the US a year might make it. It will be hard for SQ to justify someone who travels with them only once a year, is more valuable than someone who travels monthly between SIN-HKG in J. I predict if this model is indeed the one that SQ chooses, they will end up with a lot of PPS members based in the US and Europe, and very few left in Asia. It is also likely though, that they might introduce a combination of this scenario and the 2nd scenario, so that different country members will have different $ thresholds. These are just some thoughts I randomly put together.. feel free to discuss.. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5106103420257568, 0.4893896281719208]",amenity_catering_lounges

OTOH, if you originate from a low fare location such as MNL, you need 2 RT in C using PPS Sectors, while 5 or more RT in C, depending on how PPS Value is actually calculated since it involves UA, will be required using PPS Value. Also, some short flights, such as KUL, PEN etc, which were excluded before qualify now. I am not saying that I like it, however, the PPS Value system rewards customers who pay higher fares, which probably make sense from profitability point of view. Well that was somewhat of what I conveyed in my first post of this thread. Those that reside in places like the US, Germany, France just to name a few where premium tickets are priced at the top of the roof, those who can afford them will have no problems qualifying/re-qualifying under the new critieria. It is just unfair to some of us who for example pay ex-New Zealand fares and fly in greater miles but yet be on the short end compared to those ex-USA who fly in shorter miles but get them because the ticket prices are higher. I am just not pleased that the critieria will be judged according to ticket prices as oppose to frequency/mileages. In that PPS will soon be only for those superly rich individuals or companies. I guess maybe despite being one of the most profitable airlines in the industry, SQ is still not profiting enough to maintain a mileage/sector PPS criteria. Who knows.

 TG ROP is not that attractive to me and i fly MEL-BKK return every month. The W and V class fares will go to 0 miles in July in ROP (already 0 in KF). You will have to fly a minimum of Q class to earn anything on TG flights. There goes your 500 miles on TG domestic sectors for the cheap tix. At least with KF on SQ flights on the cheapest fare ex-aus there is always 100% mileage accrual and 25% tier bonus for silver and up. The downsides are there is no upgrade cert's and elite is valid for 12 months only but that doesn't worry me as i fly 50k a year anyway. Now i book J class on TG domestic for about $50 more and accrue on KF. I stick to SQ as much as I can - the Q class on TG mel/bkk is now $1230AU and SQ is usually between $1150 and $1250 for W class. For the same price i rather take the 25% bonus and 15% online reduction in points for award bookings. Plus the SQ website is lovely to use for most functions. There are pros and cons to all programs though ,"['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.6614022254943848, 0.33859783411026]",amenity_catering_lounges
" I would agree that there are more miles around, however I dont think they would end up having loads of people redeming J Awards if they opened them up across the book. QF is a lot worse than SQ for miles being available to people. The QFF which is free now if you join Woolies everyday rewards. SQ getting rid of J Savers on 77W/A380 cabins happened before the Westpac Plat Card was introduced. Also I am sure SQ would have considered the increased amount of miles due to the increase of the KF card vs the money they are getting from Westpac and whether it was worth it or not etc. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5854529738426208, 0.41454699635505676]",amenity_catering_lounges

" Not sure they had much choice to be honest... Dear Mr MAN Flyer, As we welcome the new year, we would like to share some updates to the PPS Club programme with you. EXTENSION OF YOUR PPS CLUB MEMBERSHIP FOR A SECOND YEAR The past year has been a challenging time for everyone, with mass disruptions to travel plans due to unprecedented border closures. Given the lack of flying opportunities in the past year, Singapore Airlines will automatically extend your PPS Club membership for another 12 months at the end of your membership year which is due between March 2021 and February 2022¹. Any PPS Value earned in your current membership cycle will be credited as Reserve Value at the time of membership extension. Your PPS Club membership card which would reflect a validity period ending between April 2021 and March 2022² will continue to be valid and recognised by SIA and our partners worldwide for another 12 months from the validity date on the membership card. For example, if the ""Card Expiry"" date on your membership card is April 2021, the card will now be valid till April 2022. Alternatively, you can access your digital membership card using the SingaporeAir mobile app. The validity period on your digital card will be updated to reflect your extended membership period after your membership year has been extended. As existing cards continue to be recognised, we will not be sending a new membership kit to you when your membership is extended between March 2021 and February 2022. EXTENSION OF VALIDITY PERIOD OF EXPIRING RESERVE VALUE Reserve Value that are expiring between March 2021 and February 2023 will also have their validity period extended to expire between March 2023 and February 2024. For more details, please click here. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WHEN FLYING ON SCOOT As the rewards programme of the SIA Group, we have expanded the benefits that PPS Club members can enjoy when you travel on Scoot. We are pleased to share that from February 2021, you can look forward to the following benefits when flying with Scoot, including priority check-in and boarding³, additional 5kg baggage allowance with any baggage purchase, one-time complimentary booking change and complimentary standard seat selection. Thank you for your strong support and loyalty. We hope to be able to welcome you onboard our flights in 2021. Yours sincerely, Ryan Pua Vice President Loyalty Marketing ¹ This complimentary extension will supersede the earlier renewal support scheme initiative for PPS Club members introduced on 1 September 2020. ² Members with membership extension due in December 2020, January 2021 and February 2021 will receive their new membership cards with card validity till January 2022, February 2022 and March 2022 respectively, after their respective membership extension. ³ Due to the Covid-19 situation, priority check-in and boarding are currently not available until further notice.

" Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post I think double-dipping would still be possible. SQ would track revenue and award *G based on spending. The partner FFP would track miles flown (and COS bonuses) for their own *G. It is very difficult for airlines to track interline revenue by passenger. There are discussions on TOF concerning UA's UGS program which is by revenue. The conclusion is that UA most likely only tracks revenue based on 016 tickets. It ignores revenue from other ticket stocks (undercounting) and probably counts all revenue from 016 tickets (overcounting). SQ might end up counting revenue from 618 tickets only. That is you qualify if you purchase SGD 25,000 or more in 618 tickets. ","['amenity_catering_lounges', 'krisflyer']","[0.5369045734405518, 0.46309542655944824]",amenity_catering_lounges

Other times, there are light snacks, such as mixed nuts, granola bars, whole pieces of fruits, and light snacks provided. Not very impressive at all! Free wireless Internet connection is available, and you need a password, which you will find throughout the lounge. I like the lounge and really love the cream of corn soup that I had, as well as the strawberry salad.

No doubt there are a number of PITAs among travellers. My best flight experience is actually in Y with the family to PER. The FA was super...even though we were in Y and I was a pain the butt PPS The worst was on a flight to Zurich...I was in F and family was in Upper deck J. My wife noted the food in F is more suited to my young daughter and asked if an FA in upper deck to help swap. She grumbled ""You mean I have to go all the way downstairs to bring the food up!"". My wife let it passed and had I know about it, I probably will just have a quiet word with the IFS who was mostly in F and let it close at that juncture without reporting to the feedback channel. But I can't really say it was a nasty experience...I don't really have a bad experience on SQ with the CC on any particular flight I been on..perhaps she was having just an off day.

 I have recently redeemeed an award ticket for First Class travelling JFK to FRA on SQ. I understand that SQ has a contract arragement permitting F ticket holders to use the VS Clubhouse at JFK. What I would like to know is whether I will be able to bring a guest with me into the VS Clubhouse? My guest will be taking a domestic flight on the same evening and it would be great if we could use the VS Clubhouse together. The issues I see are: a) my guest is not flying SQ that day; b) my guest is taking a domestic flight to Denver. Do you need to clear immigration and security in order to access the club lounge?

(B) Book a combination of SQ638 and SQ 12. Again, call and pray as above, although you only need availability on the SQ12 NRT-LAX leg, not both. (C) Book only SIN-NRT (whichever flight available).

Originally posted by jhm View Post Although we talk on SQT about lounges more than most people , I think we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that The Private Room is a lounge and - at the end of the day - like all lounges, simply a glorified waiting room for a journey from A to B. Most non-transit passengers don't (like some of us on here) arrive at the lounge hours and hours in advance. For most, it's a wait of an hour or so with the opportunity to grab a drink (which doesn't mean how many bottles to get through ), catch up on e-mails etc. For those who actually have a long layover, Changi Airport has plenty to keep anyone amused; and if you have an overnight, the place to stay (even if some of us don't do so) is really a hotel rather than the lounge itself. TPR is no doubt fit for purpose but it's not (nor meant to be) a life changing experience and we should align our expectations accordingly. That would be all well and good for no more than a mid tier airline going through the motions. Unfortunately it's not. This is SQ, widely accepted by many of those of sane mind and with a pulse of being the best airline on the planet. This is also the airline that 'other airlines talk about', with whom you can 'travel in a new light', have recently introduced a 'class beyond first' and last year created a 'more exclusive' FFP. On top of this they offer us the privilege of paying more than all the other airlines out there to enjoy their fabulous hospitality. So, when they spring a sub standard F lounge on us, (by 'us' I mean those of us who pay a fair whack of money to fly on them and are top tier on them and not a competitor ) folk are going to have a moan. If LH, VS, BA, CX, MH, TG etc etc etc think top quality lounges are important, there is no reason SQ shouldn't. So, MR BA Gold , you enjoy your lovely new BA lounges in the new T5, and us transit pax (as that is what most pax on SQ are) can discuss the plusses and minuses of SQ's new waiting rooms.

" Hooray, my limbo ended today! Finally, my status is lounge-dragon official again, as my KrisFlyer membership pack arrived today. So here is the summary of the process for a PPS member who downgrades to EG, based on my experience: 1. The elite miles counter reset twice: first when the counter reached 50,000 (back in late December), and then a second time (when my PPS membership lapsed). Loss of elite miles: between 2,000 and 3,000, which were accumulated between the two milestones. 2. The membership pack doesn't get sent out until PPS membership lapses. This means you get that awkward period when you can't back up your *G status with a physical card. Probably less problematic if your travels in this limbo period are on SQ, more problematic if you have the not-so-accommodating lounge dragons in Europe to contend with. 3. You'll get a phone call from KrisFlyer in Singapore after a couple of emails where you ask for a faxed letter certifying your EG status, so that you can use it with the lounge dragons. Nice touch this phone call, but I never did receive that faxed letter. OT: Is this phone call an unpublished benefit for PPS members? In nearly all my dealings with KrisFlyer when I was a QPP with an issue that needed resolution, I was pleasantly surprised by follow-up phone calls from Singapore when I used the website interface. I don't recall ever getting this kind of attention in my EG days. ","['krisflyer', 'amenity_catering_lounges']","[0.5730580687522888, 0.42694196105003357]",krisflyer

Many people I know have had to get 75,000 miles to get Elite Gold. Would you check again about this please... I never had any first hand experience for this ES and EG status. But one of my cousins reached 25K, and got ES. Thus reset to zero. Then earned another 25K.. and kaboom... an EG status. Perhaps in the case of your friends, the time span in getting 25K and the next 25K is almost 12 months. Been trying to create an example, but at the moment no time to do so. But please check with your friends, by the requalification period of when they got ES perhaps they did not reach 50K total. Thus, only still ES. Then suddenly they flew more, and got 50K. And this made them thinking that they need 75K. Let me rephrase it. January 2006 they had 25K. ES... They travel again and in December 2006, they traveled 20K. Thus short from 50K. February 2007 had 5K additional.... Then June 2007 flew 25K. And yes, it's EG. So it felt like your friend needed 75K. But actually, it was not. After hitting the ES 25K, if that 5K in Feb 2007 was flown in January, your friend had accumulated 50K, thus EG. And now the computer sees that your friend had 20K in Dec 2006, and 5K in Feb 27. In addition, June 2007 had 25K for total 50K. Therefore, EG. I may be wrong, but hope you got the idea how it works. Happy flying!

The voucher can be used for redemption bookings on economy flights or used towards economy to business upgrades. The voucher is for 25,000 points.

Arrive at UA terminal. SQ departs from TBIT. Why would you want to go to UA RCC first? I think it's better to head to TBIT and check-in with SQ, clear security, then wait for your flight in StarAlliance C Lounge. SIN-LAX-SAN You will arrive at TBIT. Clear immigration and customs.

" While some people do have legitimate grievances against what they perceived as lesser or unfair treatment, on an overall basis, SQ is still a great way to fly when in comparison with other airlines. It's schedule relatively punctual, services onboard is often exemplary, and this is rarely mentioned but I think SQ also have a great online website booking system ( krisflyer.com ). It's so easy to manage and change/reschedule my booking. I don't think SQ is perfect though, I still have some nitpicks, eg few tangible benefits for PPS, the go-by-the-book treatment of all customers, annoying cost-cutting tactics to save a few cents, lack of pro-activeness in handling of customer complaints etc but overall, yes, SQ for me is still a great way to fly.

" Originally posted by reddevil0728 View Post May I know if I can earn KrisFlyer Miles and KrisFlyer Elite Miles when flying on Virgin Atlantic? If so, how is the miles and elite miles awarded? For example, from London to New York one way, the miles they state on their website is about 3,500 miles. So do I earn 3,500 KrisFlyer Miles and KrisFlyer Elite Miles? When booking the tickets, do we give the KrisFlyer membership number and it will automatically credit into the KrisFlyer account or there is a need to register for the airline own frequent flyer program and have the miles credited inside before transferring it to KrisFlyer account? Yes, you can earn both KF Miles and Elite Miles. You can opt at booking point (if you book electronically) to credit the miles to KF by inputting your KF membership number and it will go in automatically. No need to register for VS Flying Club. Miles take about a week to post, and note that if you fly premium economy, the miles credited is only economy miles. Hope this helps.

I know that SYD-SIN-FRA-JFK is not permitted as a Star Alliance award, nor is SIN-NRT-LAX-HNL. I know this because I've attempted to book.

" Personally between SATS Premier Lounge in T2 and Plaza Premium Lounge in T1, I would choose the latter if I have plenty of time to spare. The latter has live cooking station where the cook can prepare noodles or laksa for you. There are also more plenty sit down meal area for you rather than sitting on sofa and balancing the dishes with your hands. It is usually not as crowded as well as less airlines contract it for use in Changi. There is also a view of the runway from the lounge. The SATS Premier lounge do have massage chair which you can use if no one is using, but the Plaza Premium Lounge has these productivity pods for your to seclude yourself if you need to get things done. The walk from T1 back to T2 will be far though because the Plaza Premium lounge is located on the opposite side of the skytrain to T2. Alternatively, if you are only looking for good food in a relatively quiet environment, I would recommend TGM at T2, just opposite SATS Premier Lounge. It is a restaurant run by the Plaza Premium Group and features decent Korean and Japanese food (better than the food served inside SATS Premier Lounge.

So they blocked most of the first section of the Y cabin so the heavy front of the plane is then balanced by the rear. The first section of the Y cabin has barely more than 30 pax.

" Sadly the general behaviour towards the crew by some of the pax I've witnessed on SQ flights over recent times leaves a LOT to be desired. Courtesy and good manners costs nothing, but some people treat the crew like dirt. From barking out instructions, waving their arms around and pointing, failing to look up or keeping their headphones on when having a conversation etc etc. No wonder the nickname for PPS is PITA with some crew... I always look at crew members when talking with them, I also say please and thank you and smile at them. It costs me nothing to do this and why it seems so hard for others to do the same I'll never know.

A certain SQ Steward who a number of us on here know and was with us came back from the bar to say a couple of the girls inside were colleagues of his.

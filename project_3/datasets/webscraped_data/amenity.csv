Impressions: - A nice kit design! - Too bad the launch is happening during the pandemic travel slowdown - Great that SIA finally has a J amenity kit, although I did agree somewhat with their previous position that if you were a frequent traveller, these kits would just pile up at home. - I always thought green was the colour SQ designated for Y (e.g. the old green boarding passes)...

"Definition of ""night"" flight (for F amenity kit)",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/sq-amenity-kits/3642-/page1," A question about how SQ categorises its flights... HKG-SIN is 3h40m so obviously day flights are not eligible for the F amenity kit / PJs. However, what about the flights that depart later in the evening? SQ website stipulates that amenity kits are given out on day flights of 7 hours and more, and night flights of 3h30m or more. Do they mean a flight that passes the midnight mark, or do they mean flights that depart after a certain time? PS. Also, on SQ873 HKG-SIN (2015 -> 2315), what meal is served? Is it Dinner? How is the Shi Quan Shi Mei offering, or is it better to BTC? Thanks guys! "

There can't be that many that depart so late? I agree with feedback below from SQ LPP. I recently flew SIN-HKG on SQ on a 744 as the config in F is similar to long haul SQ 744 aircraft flights. It's much better than the domestic or short haul 772 or 773's. Anyway, I was not given the amenity kit or PJ's on this sector. There are a few flights between 3h30m and 7h that are considered night flights. Couple examples are: 1. SQ638 SIN-NRT. Dep 11:40pm, Arr 7:30am. Total 6hr 50min 2. SQ423 BOM-SIN. Dep 12:25am, Arr 8:20am. Total 5hr 25min3 3. SQ602 SIN-ICN. Dep 11:50pm, Arr 7:15am. Total 6hr 25min (your flight) Cheers. "

Dom Pérignon Vintage 2004 Suites and First Class customers will now be greeted with Dom Périgon Vintage 2004 as a welcome drink. Nuanced and precise, the 2004 vintage is the natural sum of perfectly consistent parts. The 2004 vintage leaves its mark on the history of Dom Pérignon for its ease and generosity. Aromas of almond and powdered cocoa develop gradually into white fruit with hints of dried flowers. Classic toasted notes give a rounded finish and denote a fully realised maturity. On the palate, the wine instantly traces an astoundingly fine line between density and weightlessness. Its precision is extreme, tactile, dark and chiselled. The full taste lingers with the utmost elegance on a sappy, spicy note. Singapore Airlines is pleased to offer the highly acclaimed Dom Pérignon Vintage 2004 in addition to the prestigious Krug Champagne. Salvatore Ferragamo Kits in Suites and First Class From May onwards, customers travelling in Suites and First Class can experience a new gender-specific amenities kit specially designed by Salvatore Ferragamo and exclusive to Singapore Airlines. Each kit includes a 30 ml Eau de Toilette, a cleansing towel, lip balm and hand cream. The male kit features the Acqua Essenziale Eau de Toilette, a fresh fragrance inspired by water, while the female kit carries the Eau de Toilette Signorina, a fragrance celebrating the most joyous facet of a chic and glamorous young lady. Singapore Airlines is the first airline to feature these two elegant fragrances by Salvatore Ferragamo onboard. Got that e-mail for PPS club last week. Seems like the Ferragamo kits are back and usually the SIN-NRT-LAX route gets new products faster than other route. Not sure why. "

New F Amenity kits,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/sq-amenity-kits/11132-/page4," Some notes on this newish F kit: I like the design of the pouch very much. But as for the contents I wish SQ can be more innovative. For me, two items are most useful for traveling on the planes: EDT/perfume sprays and hand cream. I wish they can offer nice brands (established AND up and coming) brands for the perfume, and a really good hand cream (not things like Ferragamo which is more fragrance oriented rather than skincare). A change of contents every 3 months, and change of pouch design every 6-9 months please. They might not realize this, but small touches like this might make travelling on SQ Suites/First more interesting and keep premium passengers flying them. On a separate but somewhat related matter: Menu cover designs need to be changed more often like they did in the early 2000s. And please bring back the ticket jackets. Use environmentally friendly papers in smaller size if they want to be more responsible. Since they now have started to not rip the boarding passes maybe they can make those smaller but nicer to go with it. Rant of the day done. "

Besides the adorable plush toy, children will be entertained by the various activity packs which includes games such as Spot the difference, Tick Tack Toe, Connect the dots and a 3D farm. Charlotte and friends, and the activity kits are available on all flights to and from Singapore (with the exception of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur service). In addition, children can catch the movie  Charlottes Web on Singapore Airlines KrisWorld Inflight Entertainment Systems dedicated Young Ones channel. Children of all ages will also stay entertained by the wide range of the latest movies, including Happy Feet, Flushed Away and The Incredibles, or have their pick of the most popular television programmes and cartoons including all time favourites SpongeBob SquarePants and the Rugrats. Children can also enjoy music from the wide range of CDs which includes High School Musical and Disney Mania 4 or pit their gaming skills against each other, selecting from one of the largest game menus in the sky. Games include Disneys Winnie The Pooh, Pokémon Gold, Tik Rack Toe and Bejeweled. School-going children may also try learning a few foreign phrases before they arrive at their destinations with KrisWorlds every popular interactive language learning programme Berlitz® Word Traveler that features 22 languages. * * * Editors Note: Based on the classic children's novel by E.B. White, Charlottes Web is a story revolving around a little pig named Wilbur. Fern (a little girl on the farm where Wilbur is born) is one of only two living beings who see that Wilbur is a special animal. She then decides to raise him, the runt of the litter, into a terrific and healthy pig. As Wilbur moves into a new barn, he begins another profound and unlikely friendship with a spider named Charlotte. Their bond inspires the animals around them to come together as a family. When word gets out that Wilbur's days are numbered, it seems nothing short of a miracle can save his life. A determined Charlotte spins words into her web in an effort to convince the farmer that Wilbur is ""some pig"" and is worth saving. Charlotte's Web is an animal fable that deals with several important aspects of a happy life: friendship, heroism, constancy, and death. "

But it helps to let them know nicely at the begining of the flight ( when they're not busy with their duties of course) that you'll really appreciate it should they have any stock left. Flights into Sin do not need to keep remaining stock and they'll be more than happy to oblige if you're bringing a few home for the grandkids. "

Then, go into the lav and use another towel and place a little bit of soap in it and use it to scrub down your face just to remove all of the grime and open up your pores further, which will allow for a deeper shave with minimal strokes and help prevent nicks as well as razor rash (which my sensitive skin is prone to). after that, use 2-3 drops of shaving oil and work it into your face. rinse lightly with the hottest water you can tolerate, and lather up. shave with your razor in short strokes, and rinse the blade frequently. five minutes later and voila- i come out looking like i'm ready for my first day of college all over again. =) "

I was thinking possibly a new style that is slowly being rolled out, or perhaps this is being aligned to the new/enhanced F product due to be launched later this year (along with Bose headsets etc.). If so this could suggest a move away from the current F and J seating/cabin colours, i.e. dark brown and beige and imitation wood panels. All speculation, just guessing "

Amenity Kit : SQ F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/sq-amenity-kits/1528-/page4," While I like the Ferragamo products, I think the liquid lip balm has a problem. They're undoubtedly manufactured at normal pressure, perhaps near sea level. When you unscrew the cap at altitude, the higher pressure in the vial relative to the pressurized cabin forces the liquid out, making a mess. You have to use up a fair amount of it until it will stop doing that. At least, I think it's a pressure thing. Maybe someone has another explanation. In any case, it has come gushing out on me many times. Minor flaw. "
Amenity Kit : SQ F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/sq-amenity-kits/1528-/page4," Such an issue would indeed be caused by the reduction in pressure at altitude as you suggest (i.e. fixed higher pressure contained within the tube pushing against the contents and forcing them out into the lower pressure cabin environment) - especially because the contents will settle towards the cap end. I'd suggest upending the tube and tapping the cap sharply a couple of times to re-settle the contents towards the crimped end before unscrewing the cap. Either that, or hold the tube and give it a couple of sharp flicks of the wrist in the correct direction. Albeit without specific F experience so far I've utilised this method with success in similar situations! "

For flights consisting of two sectors, cabin crew are supposed to give you an amenity kit just on the first sector, but PJs on both eligible sectors. "

Based on what you have written....yes its the amenity kit. If she think its not for her, she shouldnt have opened the kit bag in the first place. But having said that...she opened it and saw bottles.....and didnt take that bag coz of (2) she has no use for them and (3) we do not need any more bottles in the house. So she KNEW she can take it, but chose not to. So you have answered your own question actually Try showing her this picture.... http://www.sqtalk.com/forums/showpos...7&postcount=64 You will get your answer. PJ should be issued on that flight as ascertained by the regular flyers on that route (and as posted here). If she thinks its airlines' property, then its not surprising that they took NOTHING off that flight. Hope thay had enjoyed their F experience beside the part on PJ and amenity kits.. Rgds J777 "

Hope thay had enjoyed their F experience beside the part on PJ and amenity kits.. J777, you've assumed too much from what I've written. My brother was not travelling with us. He's not impressed with SQ F from previous flights. He's a NH guy. My mom did not touch or open the kit. She guessed that there would be bottles of goodies inside because my brother and I had briefed her prior to the flight. I am guessing that she was given the kit (with the bottles of goodies) based on what she told me - a cream bag placed on the side (near the screen or somewhere?). Mom is not very specific when she speaks (and so am I ). The truth is she was not sure if she could take the kit. Based on what she's told me, the FA just 'dumped' it at the side without addressing her. Personally I think a comment such as 'Ms XXX/Mdm XXX, this kit is for you' would be more polite and would suffice. But apparently, there was no verbal exchange between them. Sounds like the pile of work your work colleagues would dump at your side at work, expecting you to know it's for you. Unimpressed. As for PJs, they were definitely not distributed to the passengers SIN-NRT. Mom heard a gentleman asking for them specifically. Anyway, mom reckons that PJs are only necessary for the NRT-LAX passengers. (SQ should really employ her since she's so penny pinching on behalf of SQ!) She and my brother share the NH mentality, so no 'stealing' PJs! Well, I never said I was particularly bright. Girls take after their mothers after all, so ... OT comment, I was eavesdropping to a Japanese lady and her male (gaijin) companion over lunch this afternoon. She was telling her male friend what a good mother she would be (she takes after her mother, mother was very good with kids, etc etc), then in the next sentence she asked him if he loves her! Silly woman, how could she be such an embarrassment to women?! "

Also, I heard another source that for NRT-LAX, it is actually NRT side who is restricting us to operate a380 due to if we do it, their own airlines e.g. JAL or ANA, their premium pax will hop over to SQ to go to US once we op the A380 to LAX. I think they already can see their own pax coming over to SQ ever since SIN-NRT A380 was launched.

First Class Amenity Kits on SQ12 SIN-NRT,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/sq-amenity-kits/7084-/page1," It is indeed what it is! Won't comment further on SQ12. I hope it was a once-off event. I personally think anyone that is in F, or splashes out on or R, on even the shortest short SIN-HKG sector should get an amenity kit if they're blowing at least 3.7k SGD one-way. Then again, I think even J pax generally get a bit shortchanged as opposed to other carriers that do give amenity kits out. Even 3-4 hours in F/R/J is enough to dry out the skin/face. A little bottle of facial mist for all wouldn't go astray, I'm sure. I'm not sure if I'm the only one but sometimes I empty a bit of the SQ mineral water into the bottle cap, just so that I can dab it on my dehydrated lips/'dry' zones. In some of the recent TRs, to get absolutely nothing on a normal flight let alone an inaugural, not even a door gift, well... put it this way: it just makes the experience that much better, to give 'premium' premium pax, whether in F or R, something they can use in-flight and take away with them - that's what I'd say is a reasonable gesture. In the end it's important to recognise alot of the amenity kits, like playing cards or teddy bears, in the end add to the experience. Whilst amenity kits may be a gimmick (albeit a slightly more useful one), it certainly doesn't detract from enhancing the passenger's experience. TPR has already been discussed at length in another thread. My thoughts are anyone who really wants to try it ought to buy an F ticket to CGK or MNL and be done with it once and for all... "

I would agree on the quality of the items in the Ferragamo kits - only the fragrance/Eau de Toilette is of decent quality, the face mist is okay, but the hand cream & lip balm are junk. I wish SQ will go more like BA F kits. On some flights getting amenity kits and some don't, it is quite reasonable and non non-sense in my opinion - and it IS the industry practice in general. Only on some Europe-Asia tag on flights on LH/LX etc. can you get amenity kits on short haul flights in J & F, and it is not consistently practiced from what I see. On SIN-MEL F mixed product-vaganza: I hope it is just a transitional period with deliveries & retirements & redeployment of aircraft. It can indeed be frustrating to buy an F ticket on SQ knowing that you may end up getting the older / (much) less desirable product should you need to change your schedule, or if flight disruptions occur.

I like lightly scented products for the face. Something fresh.

I agree with you that there are far better facial moisturizers out there (at least, so it seems to my skin ). For light fragrance, I think the best products are by Biotherm Homme. But they've discontinued what IMO was their best line: D-Stress. Just the right amount of lightness for tropical weather, coupled with effective moisturizing (and making the ageing effects of travel seem to go away ). Oops, I took your thread waaay OT, didn't I? So sorry. "

I love it...got the Ferragamo kit (same as whe i tookSQ220 (Sydney-Sing) ) BUT different PJ's on the new flight + got slippers + different socks! So I guess the new Ferragamo kits being rolled out on long-haul but only the new planes get the NEW PJ's - sort of mustard colour. Safe travels "

77W amenity kit,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/sq-amenity-kits/232-/page1," Given that this page: http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U.../amenities.jsp mentions that the turndown service (but not the amenity kit) is restricted to flights over a certain duration, does anyone know whether the amenity kit will be offered in all F flights on the 77W ? I'm hoping that the answer is yes for my HKG-SIN next month. Any idea also whether the stocks of the existing Bvlgari amenity kits will be rundown and replaced by the Ferragamo (even on non-77W flights) ? "

That's utterly disappointing. I expect that the reason for this is because it's regional. My wife obviously thinks I'm nuts though - I love collecting those. Thoroughly addictive.

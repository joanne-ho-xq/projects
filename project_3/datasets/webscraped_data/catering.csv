Is the Lobster so Great I Should Book it Twice?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/6447-/page1," Hi all Flying SQ334 and SQ281, in C, shortly and I'm pretty sure I can BTC on these segments. I LOVE lobster but am wondering if it is so great that I should book it twice or just the once? A couple more ponderings on this matter - is the meal service for SQ334 reduced because it is a late night flight? So would it be better to BTC on this segment incase the food offerings are less. And...are there two meal services on SQ281? - it leaves SIN at 8:45am so I don't think I'd feel like lobster for breakfast (I love it - but not that much!!) or do they serve a dinner later and would I get it for that? So many questions Thanks to all you wise ones who have gone before. "

You only get one meal on the SIN-ICN, ICN-SIN flights. On SQ 607 you will be served a meal after take off. You'll get an Asian (Korean) option and an international dish, an ice cream and a starter. "

AVML now officially known as Indian/Hindu Veg meal!,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10142-/page1," AVML used to mean : Asian vegetarian - which is within asia. But in the UK, Asian means indian. So the confusion started there. I wandered why at one point why my AVML tastes Chinese ex-HK but Indian when I leave from UK. So VOML was 'invented' which stands for Vegetarian Oriental Meal - meaning its made to cater to Oriental / Chinese tastes. So there you have it now... AVML is now Hindu vegetarian, VOML is Oriental (Chinese) vegetarian, HNML is Hindu meal (with meat). === PS - this affects all airlines and not just SQ. "

AVML now officially known as Indian/Hindu Veg meal!,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10142-/page1, I do think the UK is being rather unfairly blamed on this one. It would seem to me to just be about the wide variety of food covered by the term Asian and needing to be a bit more specific. It is not too surprising considering the popularity of Indian food in the UK that they are more likely to provide that style of Asian food leaving the UK to try to appeal to as many customers as possible. Now if they start having to specify which type of curry then that would be the UK's fault as definitely in the UK if you say curry people will fist and foremost think of an Indian style curry.

Mmmm, I'd say I prefer the MAS nasi lemak - in economy too. They serve with proper ikan bilis and prawn sambal, rather than chicken. See photos here: http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/cont...f-menu-biz.pdf Controversially, I also much prefer the MAS satay - it is rich and sticky and meaty, but also just burnt and caramelised enough. SQ satay is often tougher and the sauce is more watery - just my experience! MH is not nearly as good as SIA on so many dimensions, but when it comes to local food they cannot be beaten in my experience. For SQ stick to Western or Straits Chinese - e.g. BTC chicken rice if you want a taste of home "

Does anyone here have pics of how post weaning meal look like and a child meal for infant? I've made a request for that for my 1 yo (by then) kid who will be travelling with us to Perth. I was checking SQ website and the description is as follows: Post-Weaning Meal (PWMLM) Suitable for infants between 1 and 2 years old, this meal is more substantial than a Baby Meal. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest. Child Meal for Infant (CHMLI) Suitable for infants less than 2 years old, this meal is more substantial in terms of quantity and choice of meal components. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest. I can't tell the difference between the 2 and the person over the phone said they were the same (???) except portion is probably bigger for CHMLI? "

Post Weaning Meal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/12243-/page1," It doesn't actually look like that. I don't have pics, but its basically the following; Minced Chicken Minced Carrot and one more Minced Veg (can't remember). It actually tastes decent, and is awesomely healthy. But its not for all kids. My son took to it very quickly because he we have been feeding him Chicken and Carrot with little seasoning so he didn't mind that. I saw that you're book in J, so another route you could do is to book the cook Congee, let your infant have that, and ask for a spare Business Meal. Works the last time for me to LHR as well. And the Congee tastes very tasty "
Post Weaning Meal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/12243-/page1," Yes, I'd second inix's description. I also took the Post-Weaning meal last year for my 7 or 8 months old son as he was into chewy food as opposed to pureed food (Baby Meal). Travelled in J too (albeit only to TPE) but mine came in a tray with plastic casseroles. One big casserole with 2 or 3 types of minced / half pureed food inside. I also tried to BTC the Congee, but the reservations claimed it was only available for breakfast meals (IIRC, mine was brunch). The portions were quite big, my son only managed to finish like 1/3, as probably he was restless during the flight and probably just had milk not too long ago. I didn't take pictures either since I don't usually do TRs and handling my son is already too much trouble. "

You still get all the starters and puddings as per the menu, including caviar if that is part of the menu. And you can decide on the day that you'd prefer to have a main course from the menu instead of the BTC you have ordered. But in January, the caviar I had was totally flavour-freeso I wouldn't be swayed by caviar. Buy a jar of lumpfish for a few pounds/dollars from your local supermarket instead. It would be nicer. "

(I looked, but I can't find a menu on SQTALK for this segment) Well not all SQTalkers like to post menu. That's why we don't have all the menu. And yes, it reminds me that someone out there has promised to scan some menus for me, and I haven't received them yet. Yes, it's supper first, then mid-flight snack, and followed by before touch down meals, which is brunch-type meals. I understand that many of you will feel that with the arrival time at SFO before dinner time, SQ should serve heavier meals prior to land. But, remember that most pax will sleep in the plane, and when they get up they would rather have something lighter, and also the fact that the body clock time would be different than SFO time. Anyway, the supper on SQ2 will let you do BTC: Menu Grilled chicken breast with capsicum, tomato salsa and potatoes Grilled fillet of beef with shallot tarragon sauce, French beans, roasted pumpkin and black pepper mashed potatoes Pan-fried sea bass with sun-dried tomato pesto, mixed vegetables, and potatoes Stir-fried prawns and scallops with braised beans in leek and red wine vinaigrette with vegetables Braised assorted mushrooms in bean curd skin, seasonal vegetables, and steamed rice Braised pork ball Shanghai style with bok choy, carrots, and vegetable rice Chirashi Sushi Deep-fried salmon with garlic cloves, chu hau sauce, vegetables, and steamed rice Steamed egg with scallops, mixed vegetables and rice Stir-fried chicken and abalone with Chinese greens and steamed rice Thai style red beef curry, selected vegetables and steamed rice If you want, you can try order the BTC, and when aboard in HKG, tell the crew that you want your BTC to be served prior to land in SFO. Of course, the 10 hours later might affect the quality of the meals. Anyway, last time I was in this flight, I was perfectly happy with the light meals served prior to land. "

Couldn't stand up to a fry-up. If you wean yourself from milk in your tea, nickbot, you might find a breakfast tea that surpasses your beloved PG Tips (I agree too that Twinings Everyday merits a mention in the 'taken with milk' category). It's the Palace Breakfast blend from Tea Palace (I was told the InterContinental London serves it). "

I'm sorry Sir, but tea taken without milk is for savages In all seriousness, I can take some teas black (generally fruit infusions, green, jasmine, Earl Grey at a push), but certainly not a breakfast tea! I was most disappointed after ""treating"" myself to a box of TWG English Breakfast tea bags (at not insignificant cost) to come to this negative realisation; oddly enough, I actually have a pleasant memory of TWG E.B. tea when I drank it in T2 and T3 SKL J last year, both occasions when prepared in a mug.

This is even more savage than tea without milk But back to the topic: My companion had a chamomile tea (she was developing a cold) from the TWG selection and we were really baffled by the huge amount of chamomile flowers in the fabric bag. This was definitely the greatest experience I've ever had with infusions (and I'm not using the word ""tea"" here ). "

Too heavy for breakfast. Bread was super dry. But the rice was the best ever. I noticed a cover of cabbage that they removed prior to serving which did wonders to retain moisture (so explained the FA). For SIN-CGK brunch for the 740am flight, the Nasi goreng with satay was super super yummy though. Didn't take pic of the menu though so can't post it here. "

The beef was really a mess (everything was drowned in broth, the potatoes had a very strange texture and the beans had no taste at all while the only think you could taste about the beef was pepper), the scallops were ok (and quite large a serving) but I missed a spicy finish on them.

What is the new Kyo-Kaiseki meal like?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/9641-/page1," I was wondering if anyone has had the new F class Kyo-Kaiseki meal? I'm trying to decide if I want to have it in January - either out of SIN or NRT to LAX. I honestly didn't enjoy my first KK meal about a year ago. It was too ""authentic"" if that is the right description. I do enjoy sashimi and almost all Japanese foods, not just rolls, but I never warmed to the simplicity of the tastes. Based on the descriptions in the press release (http://www.singaporeair.com/mediacen...ws/NE_3010.jsp), it does seem like the menu being served would suit me better - tuna belly sashimi with cucumber and tomato jelly; lobster poached in white miso soup; grilled duck with miso-sansho sauce and teriyaki scallop). Thanks. "

Thanks J According to the website: Low Fat/Cholesterol Meal: No animal fats but poly-unsaturated fatty acids allowed; limited fats/sauces/gravy fried items; no butter/cream/whole milk cheese; only lean meat allowed I have never ordered one. So I don't know what you will get on board. But, from my personal experience, when I had to watch my health, I should eat in moderation, as well as know what I should not eat. I was able to order from the main menu by doing mis-match things up. From the definition of the low fat - low cholesterol, pick lean meat. And yeah no heavy salad dressing, olive oil should be fine I think. I will skip butter. And pick the vegetables from the menu which looks better for my health. Of course, if your doctor really wants you to have a very very strict low fat diet, that will be a different story! "

In fact I got 2 cakes! And once when I was surprising a friend on a CDG-YYZ flight around 1990 in Y, his boarding pass showed up as 'SPML' which he translated as I've booked him a special meal which he didn't want.. The crew came out halfway during the flight with dimmed cabin lights, a birthday cake with a candle (and lit as well) , a card, and champage in 2 plastic cups. Well, things would be different now..but I thought I'd share this with you! Ah such memories.... I would really have to fly on my birthday again..!

New Chinese F menu on China flights,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/12428-/page1," I was on SIN-PVG flight 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised with the chinese meal. It was a complete set (appetizer, soup, main course, and dessert), just like kyo kaiseki menu. When I asked the LSS about it, she said it's just been recently introduced (around March). Here's the details from SQ website: 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn) First Class customers travelling on selected flights between Singapore and China can look forward to a new Chinese fine dining experience with the introduction of 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn), an elegant and complete Chinese meal available for lunch or dinner service. The name - translated in English as treasured culinary creations from a famed and reputable establishment - highlights the partnership between renowned master chefs and the Airline. 名家珍馔 (Míng Jiā Zhēn Zhuàn) is specially created for Singapore Airlines by acclaimed masterchefs Sam Leong and Zhu Jun, both members of our International Culinary Panel and renowned authorities in the art of Chinese cuisine. First Class customers will be treated to timeless Chinese fare made up of an exquisite array of ingredients that will impress even the most discerning of palettes. Anyway, it was really really good and super tasty. I really recommend it! It's a pity this menu is not available for book the cook as I rarely fly to China.. Here are some pictures (a bit blurry, sorry). Appetizer and soup Main course (beef with black bean sauce, black cod fish, shimeji rice) "

The distinctive white ""Theme Building""--built by architects Paul Williams and Welton Becket in 1961--resembles a flying saucer that has landed on its four legs. Suspended beneath two intersecting arches that form the legs is a restaurant that offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the airport.

Favourite route in terms of food,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/179-/page1, Just been on the LHR-SIN flight and was thinking that it is my favourite SQ flight in terms of food offering. It has Satay an absolute must to be even considered for this award I love the Duck Rice BTC out of LHR It is the full dinner service (even if I do not like caviar) Both the 11.00am or 6.30pm departures mean you eat at a normal time I like the fact that it is dinner and breakfast. I find the SIN-LHR routes were you get Dinner and Lunch just too much and too similar.

Favourite route in terms of food,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/179-/page1," Another vote for the LHR flights. Not only excellent catering, but excellent crews as well. Seems like SQ really takes an extra step on this route. For SIN-LHR I usually go with SQ320 or SQ322 depending on how schedule works for me. If I am on leisure or in no need of a rush for meetings, I would go for SQ320. This flight IMO has the most comprehensive meal service of all the long haul sectors. I've always felt I've gained extra weight after taking this flight with a heavy lunch after takeoff and a heavy dinner before landing. Plus it arrives into town just in time for bed and a fresh day the following morning. If I am in a rush and can't sacrifice an extra day of flying, SQ322 works the best for me. Gets me into London early in the morning where I can check into my hotel and take a brief nap 8-8:30 am and be ready for my meeting or appointment. And yes I do love the SQ the fresh egg breakfast which I get on SQ322. Though I have to admit it feels awkward to be eating breakfast at 3 or 4 am UK time. And often this flight arrives (sometimes the 1st flight to arrive morning into LHR) very early that Fast Track is not opened yet and my eyes would still be in GAGA mode by the time I get out. SQ308 IMO is the worst of the 3 flights in terms of timing. Taking this flight means waking up at OMG hours for departure and by the time you arrive into LHR, its only 3PM and you still have another 7 hours to burn and stay awake. On LHR-SIN, without a doubt my favorite is SQ319. Full dinner service after takeoff with great variety of choices and quality and just in time for the pampering of turn down service for bed afterwards. Wake up for breakfast and a smooth early afternoon arrival. I've taken this flight already 3 times this year for the eastbound Kangaroo route (twice connecting to AKL, once connecting to SYD). Even though SQ321 is the flight that is suppose to connect immediately to SQ285 or SQ221, I've always used SQ319 to connect to these flights and don't mind the long layover in SIN. Gives me the opportunity to sleep & swim at the transit hotel and take care of my paper work inside the SKL for 6-7 hours. As a matter of fact will be using SQ319 again to connect to SQ285 on the return trip this month. IMO the meals on SQ321 is not as comprehensive as 319 and certainly feels strange to depart LHR at night, sleep and then wake up to realize it's near evening in SIN and certainly makes it difficult to sleep again on the following sector to Aus/NZ. I've never taken SQ317 and have no intentions in doing so anytime soon. This is by far the worst flight timing among the 3 LHR-SIN. Too early to sleep with the noon departure and then by the time you are tired, it is almost time to land into SIN EARLY MORNING. So my order of preference top to bottom from most preferable to least would be: SIN-LHR: 1) SQ320 2) SQ322 3) SQ308 (avoid if possible) LHR-SIN: 1) SQ319 2) SQ321 3) SQ317 (avoid if possible) Just a note from my experience that satay is served on SQ320 (Dinner)/319 (Dinner) but not on SQ322/321. As stated earlier, never taken 308/317 and have no idea if satay is available for these flights. Also in addition to the LHR flights, I have fallen in love with SQ286/285 operating the AKL sectors. Like SQ320, SQ286 is a daytime flight with nice meal offerings - light lunch after takeoff and full dinner (satay included) prior to landing. This 10.5 hour sector gives pax just enough time to get a feel of what F class is like by staying awake for most of the flight. On the return, SQ285 IMO is much better than SQ221 to SYD because the extra long hours of flying gives me just the amount of time needed to sleep in regular duration whereas SQ221 is just way to short to catch sufficient amount of rest. If one is flying SIN-SYD I would instead advice them to take the daytime flight SQ219 and avoid the later two overnight flights as there is just not enough flying time to get a descent amount of sleep.

I'm aware that lobster can be considered expensive if you are based in sin. Hmm, the slipper lobster is unfortunately not a true lobster, as in the sort you'd find in lobster sashimi. It is a crustacean though, so it has that same meat texture as other crustaceans, but much smaller than a true lobster. Some may find it a little underwhelming. And it's not very expensive. In Australia, it's called a bug, as in Balmain Bug or Moreton Bay Bug. I guess slipper lobster sounds better than bug. "

Should add that on my flight we asked for our meal to be served later, because we'd completely overloaded at the F Class Lounge at the Airport.

New Chinese Fine Dining Choices On Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/6443-/page1," 24 April 2009 Braised abalone with pickled cucumber Wakame seaweed soup with scallop and dried oyster Braised lamb with red dates and daikon Warm eight treasure rice with strawberry ice cream and caramel sauce These are just a sampling of the many mouth-watering creations, that will soon be tantalizing the palates of Singapore Airlines customers. From 1 May, these choices will be part of a range of new dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美) making its debut in the First Class cabins onboard Singapore Airlines flights departing from Beijing and Shanghai. Exclusive to Singapore Airlines, Shi Quan Shi Mei was conceptualised as a presentation of the richness and diversity of Chinese culinary heritage. First introduced in 2005, the latest choices for this popular inflight Chinese fine dining experience are the creations of award-winning Chinese chef Zhu Jun (朱俊), the newest member of the International Culinary Panel. Winner of Excellent Chef at the 15th China Chef Festival, Chef Zhu is currently the Vice General Manager and Executive Chef of Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering, one of Chinas leading restaurant chains, and an icon synonymous with elegance, quality and service excellence. Shi Quan Shi Mei will be presented as an elegant spread of specially created Chinese delicacies, including appetizers, a double-boiled soup, four entrees, and dessert. Customers can look forward to savouring these new dishes, which carry Chef Zhus signature Shanghainese touch, with clear notes of provincial influences. Well known for his innovative approach to the creation and development of new dishes, Chef Zhu has also taken several classic ingredients and transformed them into dishes that will leave customers impressed by the versatility of modern Chinese cuisine. When designing and conceptualising the individual dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei, I sought to keep true to age-old Chinese culinary traditions, while also adopting a philosophy that emphasizes the use of the freshest produce. The choices we will be presenting all involve the regions choice seasonal ingredients, said Chef Zhu. He added: I am happy that Singapore Airlines has given me this opportunity, to showcase to the world, the remarkable new developments in Chinese cuisine. I hope that Singapore Airlines customers will like the new choices in the Shi Quan Shi Mei lineup, and I look forward to creating even more dishes for their enjoyment. The new dishes for Shi Quan Shi Mei will be available on the First Class cabin of flights departing from Beijing and Shanghai. Customers onboard flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, and San Francisco (via Hong Kong) will continue to enjoy popular dishes designed by Singapores very own Sam Leong, another world-class chef on the International Culinary Panel, whose creations regularly grace Shi Quan Shi Mei menus. About the International Culinary Panel Since its inception in 1998, the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel continually pushed the envelope, in redefining inflight dining on Singapore Airlines. Tasked with satisfying the demands of an increasingly sophisticated traveller, the Panel has evolved over the years to reflect the diversity of excellent cuisine around the world as well as to demonstrate the Airline's commitment to offering the finest inflight dining experience to its customers. The Panel works closely with the Airlines own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available on board.

Seafood meal questions,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8351-/page1," Everytime I fly SQ I always get tempted to try their Seafood meal, but I always think it is not going to be something really special since SQ is cutting costs. Once I tried ordering it through the phone, and they told me since I'm in Y I can't order seafood (I presume he was thinking I wanted to BTC ) So, what does a seafood meal consist of? More importantly, how does it taste? My next few flights with SQ are to PEK (J), HKG (Y), LHR (Y) and SYD (F). Thanks in advance "

The total flight time seems to be 8:15 hours - presumably this doesn't include the refueling stop in BAH ? Assuming that's the case, was it a total flight time of around 9-10 hours ? Not that much quicker than a 747 today but I seem to remember reading somewhere that Concorde was limited in its speed over land due to the sonic boom etc ? Apart from the kudos of flying supersonic, it's also interesting to see that the food options nowadays in SQ F (even leaving aside BTC) seem a lot better than on Concorde.

Just returned from a round trip today and found out the food was totally changed , flown them also earlier this month but food is as usual bad . But today is surprising.. Morning flight SQ 951 1. Beef Rendang with Rice ( side view gosh it looked yummy ) I ordered this one but the steward mistakenly gave me the Crepes, never mind I need something light. 2. Choco crepe rolled with Cherry Jam with a peach .surprisingly its good ! What I love most is no more omelet and sausage LOL ( Normally no choices and they gave you only these ) Return Flight SQ 960 Steward : Sir , would you like chicken with rice or beef wif potato ? 1. Chicken with Rice ( I thought its the normal hainanese chicken with rice( rice always so dry) with pak choy and mushroom ) indeed its curry chicken with some curry vegetables and rice , and it looks yummy. too bad i didnt choose it. 2. Beef sausage with Mash potato and green beans. I took this one gambling , but its GOOD ! the sausage is not normal sausage but somehow more meaty and tasty. Mash potato was so great. the green bean is well cooked. The side dish ( new one too , its wonderful ) Do they changed the menu ? Sorry for messy report "

I think the difference is in the type of lobster. So the F lobster would be normal size of lobster. I find it too creamy, too cheesy, too much mushrooms for ex-SIN.

My problem with it and i think it is a major issue is the legumes / lentils. They seem to be chickpeas and lentils to me, but what were served were chewy. I suspect undercooked. I don't think it was intended. If the chickpeas were soft and moist, and the lentils like how puy lentils supposed to be, then I think this dish could have been a favourite of mine.

My dearest StarG: Just in case this rumour goes circling round again like many others on the board. Here is my sincere humble reply to you. The panel of Wine Connoisseurs (featured in the wine list) conducts an independent bidding and blind tasting every year. They narrow down their choices according to classes, price for its quality and the amount of bottles (bulk) SQ can purchase. Thus, they will not select one chateau that can support ONLY one month of supply. To put it in short, it's an official tender exercise...just like any other purchase but decided independently by the 3 wine experts. Mr StarG, do you know how much of products are consumed on board? I hope this will straighten the rumour that goes around. -The Insider Loop- "

Prices of wines served onboard SQ,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5378-/page1," Okay, let me try to clarify. This post is dedicated to both of you, dearest SQ LPP and Sqstalker: Yes, from what I have heard, some of the wines they served in First Class was F.O.C. to the airline in exchange for the publicity received in the air. Originally posted by SQ LPP But who can afford giving out $150 wine for each flight for the whole year? I would be so surprise if the winery does that. How can it survives financially? As to how long the deal was, how can the chateau survive giving away (so much) free products, and the economic impact to the chateau itself: I have no information about those. For example, if it was a limited time, it may be manageable for the chateau. Another possibility is that they negotiated with the chateau AFTER the selection by the wine panel is finalized. Another thing to note is that a USD150 bottle of wine is only a USD150 bottle of wine to you (the customer), but not the chateau. But fact is it was done and perhaps is still being done. Do realize, from the beginning I did not say that it is a negative thing about SQ. Both of you made it seems like it is a very negative issue & cost cutting etc., which I don't understand why. I am actually just amazed at the marketing prowess of our favorite airline. PS: You misread the '' this time. It was not you. "
Prices of wines served onboard SQ,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5378-/page1," I think what StarG is talking about happens with some airlines and the food they serve onboard. The airline (or catering company) will of course get a bulk discount but presumably there's some additional benefit (heavily discounted or even free produce maybe) in featuring prominently the name of the brand in the menu. An example (for BA - not SQ) is the olive oil served in F. The ""advertising"" of the brand name in the menu obviously has an effect on some VIP frequent flyers, e.g. http://www.sqtalk.com/forums/showthr...5655#post55655 "

I stilll have a bottle of '92 somewhere courtesy of an empty CX F flight a few years ago! Haven't got enough experience in F to speak about the wines. From memory, CX served William Deutz Cuvee on some routes and Krug on others. SQ serves both DP and Krug long haul, and only DP on the shorter regional routes. CX wines can be rather hit/miss in J though, SQ whilst predictable is rather dependable. As for the fizz I find it pretty bizarre how CX serves the v delicious party in a mouth, Billecart-Salmon NV (seriously, I'd drink this over DP!!) on its regional routes other than NRT yet offer the paint stripper Champagne Deutz on its long hauls plus NRT! I do realise these things are YMMV but Deutz has been massively unpopular with everyone I've spoken to, even the most ardent CX fans. Surely you'd want to serve the good stuff on your premier routes. SQ serves Charles Heidsieck Mis En Cave which is pretty good as far as NVs go though some of the disgorgements can be rather 'green.' For the best onboard wine list though - I find LH truly a class act in F! And NZ and QF rather solid in J when it comes to the reds and whites, with NZ and CX regional coming out tops for J fizz with the Laurent Perrier NV and Billecart respectively. YMMV of course. "

As I mention many times, not fond of lobster thermidor ex-SIN due to the flood of mushrooms on the sauce. In the past year, I have not ordered chicken rice as BTC since it seems the BTC chicken rice is too dry. Also, SQ12 departs after 9am. I will enjoy heavy breakfast at the lounge such as dim sum or noodle soups. I will get my fix of chicken rice while I am in transit in Singapore. And yes, the meals served onboard SQ12 SIN-NRT would be about lunch time. Thus, I want something a bit heavier which lamb or beef will serve me well.

From my experience (well unless everything has changed in the 10 months) For SQ11 LAX-NRT-SIN you will be able to have the BTCs: Lunch Light meal (prior to land at NRT) Dinner (for NRT-SIN segment) Thus, you don't need to have the same thing, i.e. Japanese meals, for those three meals service (if my interpretation of what you wrote being all the way to SIN). From the regular menu (look at the sample of previous menu in the SQ F menu thread) the Japanese menu is always available, in addition to the international menu. Thus, I personally will not do a BTC for kyo-kaiseki on SQ11. Another reason is also the fact that I don't think LAX catering would be a great one to make a kyo-kaiseki. Ex-NRT, for dinner, as I previously mentioned, the lobster thermidor tastes better IMHO, and if there is kuro buta or wagyu beef on the menu, it would be a better choice. Again, for your return on SQ12, I don't agree with doing a BTC for chicken karaage. But that's just me who is a bit fussy and picky in eating. "

I myself think it's kind of strange to have tiny cube yams mixed with rice. I love yam, but usually only certain yams which are boiled, steamed fried. You may try and you can let us know what you think! But here is the picture from one of my flight where I was the biggest pita of all. I had BTC for the steak. I told the crew that I opted not to have the steak but picked from regular menu. And I would give my BTC to the crew to enjoy. But the crew decided to offer the steak to the only other fellow pax in F, which was gladly accepted. Duck yam rice was in one of the choices on the menu. I mentioned to the LS that I don't like the yam rice due to the taste of the yam mixed in the rice. But I will just have the duck which came with yam rice, and had steamed rice instead. Guess what? The LS removed all the yam pieces from the yam rice so that I could have the taste of the rice that had been cooked with yam. Here you go! Yes it was a good tasty rice! Yummy especially with those moist boiled nuts on the side, "

"""Does Airline Food Always Have to Suck?""",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8394-/page1," That's because they place costs considerations above everything else. Why would an airline want to spend extra when they can continue to get the same revenue and give less service. There was a post somewhere here showing their costs has gone down. Along with it, quality has to suffer. Don't get me wrong. Their marketing still impresses people and they have demonstrated if you are white, can argue well or shout loud enough, you will get your way. Some of their FAs can still provide passable service. I'm sorry if this offends but it is very very true. As someone posted, they are good but not Great. SIA = Some Improvements Appreciated. "

That old favourite, Lobster Thermidor, is on the list. What I find interesting is that while the dish appears in various BTC menus, the source of lobster in this case is NZ lobster, whereas ex-SIN or ex-USA is is Boston Lobster. "

I'd reckon just as good from Japan. But do note if you have a night which is a sleeper service (e.g. SQ635) its a reduce meal and instead of a 2 set Bento meal it is 1 only (reduced meal) I do agree. It works well as an airplane meal unlike some dishes that taste good on the ground but disappoint in the air. Wish you can order the sake ahead too...hahaha... I had that run out once. Oh yes... be a bit careful of the sleeper service. One less bento!

When I saw that I couldn't select the other options online, I called to ask if they could help me place my order but they told me that I could strictly only choose from the breakfast selection. concept|infinit - if your flight includes a supper service, you can order your lobster and request that they serve it to you for breakfast. For supper - provided they have enough, they may offer you one of the on-board meals. Beware though - your lobster may not taste very good by then. If your flight only has breakfast served.... well, too bad. But I find their Nasi Lemak and Bryani fairly decent, if you like local dishes. "

Its cos they don't have a category under VOML. That's why they gave you AVML. I'm pondering about the same situation under my LX flight in a few days. I might order VLML but I'm more concerned if they give me pasta (which I'm wheat intolerant).. Edited: Swiss has VOML http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/fly_swis...ial_meals.aspx

SQ First Menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/68-/page7, Pardon me... anyone has the menu for 972? 
SQ First Menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/68-/page7," Some notes I wrote this morning regarding a wine frequently served in SQ First Class (and seen on many lists posted above)... SQ has been serving Chateau Cos d'Estournel in F for a couple of years at least, maybe many more. I'm a proud fan of California wines, so I typically just ask for the American Cabernet when I get to my entree, typically beef. I often have a New World chardonnay with the first course. Well, I'm (dangerously) starting to get into Bordeaux. And wouldn'tchaknowit, when I went to the grocery store yesterday, they had the Cos right there in the wine cellar, and at a decent price too. So I figured, why not give it a try and see if I like it? A preview, hopefully, for my next SQ 001. After some consideration, I picked it up and had it with cheese last night after dinner. (See? I really do this on the ground too, not just in the air!) As expected, when I opened it, it was very tight and tannic. But after an hour in the decanter, it had opened up nicely, as expected. Tannins had smoothed out nicely, the earthiness-smokiness typical of Bordeaux had come through, though not with the power of some bigger Chateaux. An hour further (by this time, we had gotten through about half of it), and it had opened up even more, a distinct black cherry flavor could be found and some vanilla too. So I resolved... If SQ has it on SQ 001 when I fly in a couple of months, I'll definitely forego the California--unless it's one I absolutely adore--in favor of the Cos. But, I will ask the Singapore Boys to open the bottle and pour me a glass right after takeoff and serve it with my Singapore Sling. I won't drink the wine until we've progressed to the entree--BTC beef, most likely--but that should give the wine at least a bit of time to oxygenate. At the oxygen levels of a Megatop in flight, it will need quite a bit of time. "

If you don't call ahead, or the requirement is based merely out of personal preferences, they'll obviously see what they could do, but no guarantees. So whilst they may well fetch you something from a different class to cater for your preferences, such treatment certainly shouldn't be expected as a matter of course. "

On the other hand, I was on UA business for LAX - NRT and asked for cup noodles since I did not fancy their tidbits on offer, only to get the reply that they do not stock cup noodles as the flight was supposed to be shorter than usual (due to direction/route or whatever winds), offered me nuts or fruits instead.

SQ 227 SIN-2100 MEL-0715* (Dinner and Continental Breakfast Service) It's only 7 hours flight, shorter than SQ221 SIN-SYD. I don't really know what you plan during the flight. But the full dinner service will take hours. Thus, I would rather sleep afterwards till prior to arrival rather than being woken up for breakfast. This old man needs the sleep! But,, yeah I know someone who ate big meal after taking off from SIN, and had laksa prior to land in NRT on SQ638 (shorter flight time). So perhaps Mr. H can handle full dinner service meals and 2 or 3 hours later have Yu Pian Mi Fen. I tried this dish before. Like noodle soup right? (If my memory serves me right.) SQ 853 HKG-1330 SIN-1720 (Lunch Service) Why not trying the Chinese set menu onboard? Have you tried it before? I know the catering uploads limited amount, but if you can convey the message to the LSS or LS that you really want to try shi quan shi mei they might hold one for you. The sample of the menu is like this. Last time I bought roast goose from HKG and had some on board in addition to the main course I had. SQ 318 SIN-1255 LHR-1855 (Lunch and Light Meal) This one is a bit tricky. It used to be lunch and dinner prior to arrival in London. But now it's light meal. Here is an example of the menu. What I will do if I take this flight is to order ""heavy"" meal for the light meal. For me, chicken curry peranakan is fulfilling enough, but many friends of mine would say the beef or rack of lamb would be better choice. Regarding kyo-kaiseki, I don't find it as a good choice ex-SIN. I don't know why, but seems too cold and not tasty. (Well, hopefully nickbots can post what they did in their flight SQ318 last July before it became A380. "
"BTC in F on SQ227, 863 and 318",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5426-/page1, Thanks SQ LPP - some thinking to do... Disappointing about the catering on the SQ318 - you'd think for a daylight flight of that length they'd do two full meals. Should have said - my plan on the SIN-MEL flight is to eat in the city and try to sleep straight away on the plane. Then have the soup for breakfast. I'm not good at sleeping on planes so I don't imagine anyone will have to try very hard to wake me - but I'd sacrifice a bowl of soup for a good night's sleep!

If I am not mistaken, even though it's light meal as second meal service, you can still pick a BTC. Thus, you can have something more fulfilling rather than the ""an uninspiring light meal"" (according to a PM from one of SQTalkers). I would go for the beef, rack of lamb or chicken curry peranakan. For the later, being Asian, chicken curry and rice is fulfilling enough for my dinner meals. Since you mention you like soup, the Snack service in between lunch and light meal service, they usually serve noodle soup. I like the doo doo noodles - fish ball with rice vermicelli soup. "

I confess when I first opened the HKG menu link I didn't scroll down and wondered what I was missing. Second try and I spotted it. I will certainly go for the shi quan shi mei. Is it guaranteed that they'll have it or should I book the abalone just in case? I'll also think again about the kyo kaiseki - perhaps try the laksa instead. But the chicken curry peranakan sounds like a good one to go for. I still intend to eat heartily in the city before the MEL flight. I have five hours layover and I count food as one of the real joys of travelling. I'd much rather forego the SQ luxury and have a good Peranakan meal or eat at the Tekka Centre hawker market or eat a mutton curry with my fingers instead. These are things I simply can't do in Edinburgh. Singapore is one of my favourite cities and it's a shame that most tourists don't look beneath the surface. It would be criminal to be half way around the world and not enjoy their (your?) wonderful food. Maybe I'll sleep on the plane, maybe I won't, but I should be shattered after a very early start from DEL! Gosh, I wish I were rich and could do this more often! "

I am not so sure the average of how many uploaded by the caterer. That's why you should inquire nicely about it to the crew first. And yes, you still can BTC and tell the crew that you would rather forgo the BTC because the shi quan shi mei looks more appetising. Indeed, even for 3 or 4 hours I always try to have some local foods. (Many SQTalkers here have seen me crazy in eating certain local favorites! Even more snacks to carry on board as well. ) But again, my body clock has always been ready for the full dinner service such as on your flight time frame (took SIN-SYD or SIN-AKLmany times). Thus, I was not completely forgo the SQ F hospitality! Perhaps you will not get shattered on flight, but have more spirits to stay awake enjoying the excellent service from the crew. AFAIK, with this short flight time, the crew would not have time to sleep. "

AFAIK, yes you can do two BTCs for SQ318, one for lunch and one for light meals. Same list as shown in the web. It's similar to SQ11 LAX-NRT which serves lunch and light meals as well. In the menu, the light bites are the snack service between two meals. Light bites offer noodle soup, sandwiches and snacks stuff. I have never done a doggie bag except for the cakes. I think looking at the time of arrival, you are better off having the curry peranakan or laksa prior to land. It would be good to complete the experience onboard SQ. "

The drawback compared to the ""full meals"" is there are less choices and no soup & salad. But the portion is more than genereous (at least for me). Yes you can BTC for light meals but portion size won't be much of a difference from the portion you'd get for the light meal main course. Of course if you ask which I prefer, I would prefer a ""full meal"" as a broader range of variety never hurts. Still if one feels that what's being offered for light meals is insufficient, one can always opt for something from the snack menu a couple of hours before they start serving the light meal. "

I might get it if they have some exotic fruits in it or maybe even if there are an assortment of berries in it. I doubt it however, seeing as there have been massive cost cuts in the catering heh If its a platter of the usual fruits I'll pass. "
Special Meals: Fruit Platter (Y),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8309-/page1," I seriously think it's just an assortment of the usual fruits you get onboard and not anything exotic due to problems of freshness, availability, etc. Now if they chopped them up and added a large scoup of ice cream, along with fresh cream and chocolate syrup, I would be tempted to try! However I don't think my doctor would be too happy! "

F: Book the cook question MEL-SIN-FRA-JFK,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8790-/page1," Just a few BTC questions; flying out MEL (suites)-SIN-FRA-JFK return next week and just wanted to know: 1) The lobster out of MEL...can't find any pics or reports of this. Any good? The BTC options ex MEL don't seem particularly appealing, so I'll stick with the Lobster unless someone tells me it's terrible. 2)Ex SIN: So many options. I don't want red meat for supper, so I've ordered the Chillian seabass....is this good? Again, not many reports of this dish; people seem to always go for the beef or lamb or lobster. Also, for breakfast, I am having the Yu Pian Mei Fen as I remember this dish fondly from childhood..has anyone ever tried it here on BTC F? Also, has anyone tried the papardelle with seafood? Is it good? It sounded interesting but i didn't want to see seafood and pasta drowning in a cream sauce. 3)Ex FRA: Like MEL, quite a limited selection. Was going to go with the lobster (boring), but changed to the roasted Veal Knuckle with bavarian bread dumplings. Has anyone had this? Sounds hearty and local. 4) Ex JFK: Quite a few good options. This one I really can't decide. I ordered the long Island Duck in natural jus. Any good? I am also equally torn with the other 2 contenders: Roasted sea bass with wilted spinach and glazed crab-mashed potatoes and Grilled shrimps and scallops in tarragon mustard sauce with leeks, carrots, and linguini Having agonised over these choices...I'm a sucker for lobster, no matter what it looks like, so if any of the above choices are not that good, tell me and i will gravitate to the default setting. Thanks everyone. Long live SQ. Qantasclub. (but I have divorced myself from Qantas ages ago) "

F: Book the cook question MEL-SIN-FRA-JFK,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8790-/page1," BTC seabass ex-SIN is great, I've done it two or three times. The only problem with it now is that if you're flying F or R, you get access to TPR. And guess what fish figures prominently on the menu? Yep. Seabass. Booyah... so it defeats the purpose of ordering BTC seabass now for me. I just have it in TPR as a snack first. And especially flying R, it's a nice appetiser! You can even try asking for a double lobster, like someone's infamous multi-foie gras burger here and set a new record... I doubt the lobster ex-SIN is bigger than the lobster ex-MEL. You should see the last few I had... could be mistaken for a slightly overgrown prawn! Speaking of which, you can do unlimited lobsters in TPR. Which again defeats the purpose of having it in BTC. So, I'd go for something you can't get in TPR, like a yummy Kyo-Kaiseki (unfortunately this tends to be exactly the same little tidbits the last couple of times, some variation would be welcome!) My 2 cents... "

F: Book the cook question MEL-SIN-FRA-JFK,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8790-/page1," I've been more disappointed than not with BTC esp this year. Not only is the menu dated, but the caterers seem like they have lost their passion. The whole idea needs a major relook. I think a better approach is to offer pre-flight meal selection (inclusive of an ongoing menu and a changing flight specific menu) a few days ahead of departure. If not anything, it may prevent wastage as the plane need not stock extra meals to cater to onboard selection. "

Other than the fact that it'll be fish/seafood (duh), I'm wondering what style it's usually done in, do they usually serve fish or shrimps out of Singapore and HK and if it's a fish dish, does it typically smell/taste fishy or is it pretty nicely done?

I think the ""standard"" out of NRT seems to be better, but the one out of Singapore is not bad too. You can actually request for a mix. For eg, I like to ask to start with the caviar from the International menu, then move on to the Kaiseki for the starter and main course and then switch back to dessert from the International menu. But this is always subject to availability and I always request this nicely from the stewardess and ask that she does so only if there's extra available. The F meal is the same whether its SQ11/12 or the 380 suite. The meal or wine (or the entertainment) is definitely not a ""class beyond first"". "

Seats were still good but of course being the 744 they were still using the old Krisworld system (which I do not mind really) but the screens would seem a bit small if you are used to those on the 77W / 380! Flight in Y was full-ish (around 95%), not sure about loads in J or F though... Sorry won't be doing the FRA-JFK sector anytime soon (last time I travelled to the states was almost 10 years ago!!!) and if I do SQ25 or 26, it would definately be between Europe and Asia.... "

Due to code sharing, even if the seat select screen shows many empty seats, it will suddenly change dramatically nearer to departure date esp in Y. I was on the 744 recently from Christchurch to Singapore and yes, the screen looked so tiny and dated with lousy resolution (and scratched). I guess I am spoilt by the 77W... haha...

Some Qs about First Class BTC,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5198-/page1," So in my latest attempt to procrastinate, I have been thinking about some SQ Flights coming up in December, ex-HKG and ex-SIN. I have decided to BTC on 2 of the flights, and eat off the regular menu for the other flights. As an infrequent SQ Flyer, that'd give me a taste of both regular SQ F dining, as well as F BTC. I have confirmed the Chilean sea bass out of HKG as it's one of my fave things to eat (on the ground), and the one out of HKG doesn't have shellfish ingredients cf ex-SIN which has a bouillaise sauce. I am then undecided between the Kyo Kaiseiki or the Rack of Lamb ex-SIN. Some Qs for the experts: - Is it true that the lamb appears regularly on the onboard menu (i'm flying SIN-MEL), in which case rendering it pointless to BTC? I think I read this somewhere on TOF but I can't find the actual post now. - Does the Kyo Kaiseiki meal contain shellfish? I couldn't tell from the pictures. - I can't find any menu for SQ211, which is the seasonal 4th frequency to MEL. Is that a breakfast or lunch flight? It departs at 1045. If breakfast I suppose I'd have to find another ex-SIN flight to BTC on as the choices for breakfast on the BTC menu don't seem too appealing. Any advice is appreciated, as always. "
Some Qs about First Class BTC,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5198-/page1, Kyo kaiseki definitely has seafood. I can't recall if it has shellfish or not (perhaps not).

Some Qs about First Class BTC,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5198-/page1," Well I guess you must be a lamb lover. The advantage of you BTC-ing it is that you will be guaranteed to have that dish should it not be among the ones listed on the regular menu. BTW, the lamb is not the only BTC dish that has also appeared on the regular menu. I have had Nasi Lemak and Yu Pian Mi Fen on my F menus ex-SIN as well. As for Kyo Kasei, the last time I picked it off the menu was April last year and it had fish but no shell fish. Never BTC the kyo kasei myself. Just another reminder that should you find something more appetising for your taste off the onboard menu, you can always swap it from your BTC dish. Nevertheless enjoy your flight. "
Some Qs about First Class BTC,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5198-/page1," Yes I do love lamb, but I guess it's pointless to BTC if it features regularly on the onboard menu.

SIA writes for the different legs SQ321 Supper/breakfast (I suppose it's breakfast than supper?) SQ285 Supper/breakfast (supper than breakfast ?) SQ282 Supper/breakfast (no idea on this one, supper after take off in the middle of the night makes no sense, supper in the morning either...)

Most people do not want a heavy meal just before arrival because they'll have dinner later (either on another flight or in the city). SQ (and indeed most airlines with such a schedule) serve breakfast rather than lunch (which would be more applicable to the local time zone) because they want people to sleep and most passengers' body clock will be telling them it is breakfast time not lunch time. Trust us - it will make sense when you take the flights. "
Flights that don't give you the FULL SQ catering experience,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5653-/page2," dskrt, I have clarified with 1 cabin crew of mine, SQ 321 is indeed serving Supper / Breakfast. Per the norm, the first meal will be served according to the origin time, and second meal will be served according to the destination time. SQ 321 departs at 2205hrs from LHR and scheduled to land around 1900hrs SIN time. For this flight only, it is special case (which I do not know why), so 2 full meals are being served for this sector, Supper is served because by the time you take off and settle down in yr seat, the time will be after 2300hrs, thus first meal is supper. The second meal is considered breakfast because by the 2nd meal,it will be morning in LHR. (But in the economy class menu, the second menu will simply be called ""Before Touch Down"" Menu). Auckland sector, SQ 282, yes, it is Supper + Breakfast. As flight is about 10 hours, there will be 2 full meals provided. First meal Supper is under the full meal category, refreshment/light meal is considered not a full meal, so for the money you paid, to enable to have a full meal, Supper is the best full meal available for 1am flight.

I hope you enjoy your stay here. Once you step into our airport, be fascinated as this airport has won numerous awards these past few years. SQ285/286 is a popular sector due to the timing thus the aircraft used is the B777-300ER. Are you in business class? If you are, you will be enjoying a fully flat bed. There will be direct access to the aisle for every seat as the configuration is 1-2-1. Also, the entertainment of movies & music will be much more than the B777-200ER. These seats & entertainment similarly are found on our existing A380, A345 as well as A330 which proved popular with SQ customers. As for SQ282, yes, the beds are SpaceBed in Business class, similar to those found on the 747 jumbo. The seat configuration of this aircraft will be 2-2-2. Hi Chesty, My turn to reply your message. Are you in business or economy firstly? If you are in business, it is a sleeper service, meaning to enable passengers to sleep longer & have undisturbed rest, only 1 meal will be served. Thus a full meal supper is served. If you are in economy, no sleeper service, thus 2 meals will be served, Supper + Breakfast (Menu will indicate ""Before Touch Down"" Menu). If you prefer other flights serving 2 meals, it will be SQ238 and SQ228. Just fyi from 29 Sep onwards, the A380 will be operating on SQ228 on a daily basis. "

Its a pity they don't have Polo Club on the menu. This is a green tea with a distinct caramal flavour. Somewhat similar to Paris-Singapore actually but better IMO TWG has retail boutiques at the airport, Republic Plaza, the Ion, dine-in salons at RP and the Ion. Was at the Ion branch today. They're fantastic.. They've got over 400+ different teas, mainly their own blends and connoisseurs to recommend teas to you.

Well, here we go again: Ive been trawling through the BTC forums. Its a fascinating read for a BTC virgin like me, especially the flyertalk post by jjpb3 in the BTC Experience Do's and Dont's. I have a few basic, but hopefully, not dumb questions to ask. Ill try and make this simple. 1. On SQ2, SIN-HK-SFO, three meals are served on J class: dinner on the SIN-HK route, and supper and breakfast on the HK-SFO route. Should I be making my dinner selection ex-SIN on the SIN BTC link, and my supper and breakfast options ex-HK on the HK BTC link, or should I make all my three meal selections on the SIN BTC link. I was so looking forward to trying the nasi beryani for breakfast. 2. The BTC options ex-SFO dont look particularly exciting, well at least to me. Can any SQtalkers recommend something theyve tried. 3. I notice that satay is not served for dinner on SQ 2 SIN-HK. Is this because the flight is too short? Darn it but it looks like I am going to miss out on satay for all sectors on both SQ 2 and SQ 1 as there is a total of two breakfasts, two suppers, one (short) dinner and one brunch. Thanks for your inputs! "

kosher meals what to expect with Singapore Airlines,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7467-/page1, First Time Back since 2003 in Economy Class for me and have ordered kosher meals for my trip to Vietnam with Singapore Airlines. What do I expect the meals to consist of and the standards of them or does that depend on the outbound station suppliers catering service. Any help would be most welcome 
kosher meals what to expect with Singapore Airlines,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7467-/page1," FYI Kosher meals are not made prepared in Singapore. SQ buys them frozen from somewhere else. Europe probably where a larger Jewish community would ensure the quality of the meals. Having said that, your meal will be in a sealed plastic wrapped package which the FA will bring to you to break the seal yourself. Then the package will be brought back to the galley for reheating. Everything will be disposable. ie cutlery will be plastic, meal container probably will be foil. Can't vouch for the quality of the meal as I've never had one before. "

Passengers who have ordered a Kosher Meal (KSML) are only served fish for the main course. This may occur especially when The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) has however, banned the import of cooked chicken (due to avian flu) and beef (due to mad cow disease) from the UK. The only meat type that is available is fish. Singapore Airlines have been actively sourcing for other caterers that may be able to provide KSML. The local synagogues have been contacted but the quality standard was not found to be acceptable. Hope this helps! "

I don't do pork anyway... plus, it's an F request... shouldn't that have a reasonable chance of something good? Actually no. Kosher meals are set up that way. The portions might be slightly larger .. but everything will still be in plastic, wrapped in foil and disposable. Larger portions only on what is 'standard' . It will not be based on what SQ will spend on a special meal. Or maybe not even. Sometimes you just get what is given, as a TV dinner. Maybe you might get two economy class servings instead of one as a F class passenger. You will not be allowed to use the normal cutlery, and the food cannot be placed on the lovely SQ china. You just have to sit there and eat what's given to you. Oh ya, you break the seal first. Otherwise that won't be kosher then, will it now? KSML is based on religious standards. KSML does not mix dairy and meat together. No shellfish. Everything according to strict kosher standards. It will be easier if you just specify that you don't want pork. But as a F class passenger, you may just pick and choose what you want or don't want to eat. "
kosher meals what to expect with Singapore Airlines,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7467-/page1," Thanks for that - yes, I did do quite a bit of research on what constitutes a KSML before making the request with SQ. I would be shocked if they only gave two economy class servings instead of one 'premium' kosher F meal when travelling as F pax. As long as it is delicious, I'm willing to give it a try. I'm not concerned about how much SQ 'spends' on this meal. If anything, I'd have thought they'd spend more flying it from their source in the UK?! If you had instead said 'the food is likely to be bland', I'd be on the phone with SQ to change it right away. Wrapped in plastic/foil - OK with me. No shellfish is fine with me. Their lobsters are pathetic anyway. No mixing of dairy and meat is also fine with me. I can live with that. Breaking the seal - well, that's to ensure certain hygiene/religious standards. Also fine with me. And I would be surprised if they didn't break the seal and lay it out on SQ china... if they are not supposed to, I'd ask for them to do so after breaking the seal. I would think they would comply, no? If all else fails, I will have what is on the standard menu. This F KSML order, as I alluded to above, is more for fun/scientific purposes. In a way, it's just for you. "

I do have to agree with Guy Betsey on this one, do not set your expectations too high on this as I think you will be disappointed.

It's standard herbal chicken with a good dose of thickish gravy rather than soupy. The mushroom sides were nice and fresh. To me it's one of the better Asian dishes. "

special meal - SFML for breakfast...what to...?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/12671-/page1," HI, I'will be flying in C class from SIN to CDG and when I was making request for BTC meal for supper I noticed that also I can make choice of sepcial meals for breakfast, so now I decided to have breakfast like a SEAFOOD meal. System accepted my order, but to be honest I don;t know what to expect as a seafood breakfast on this flight ...so any idea ? Still I am not sure whether I made a good choice or is it better to stay with normal choice of breakfast from the menu onboard... ANy suggestions ? And as BTC for dinner I choose grilled seabass and lobster thermidor for my brother...is it ok ? And finally last question - as departure from SIN is quite late 23:55 LT the super instead of dinner will be served, so is it means that we will not have a ""prelude: (satay) and dessert at all ? Am I right that super is limited only to starter and main dish, so without dessert and cheese plate ? Thanks for your help Adam "

It is usually done by the Caterer and the menus don't change often. If i were u, i would rather pick a BTC instead. "

Like the fact that it was quite generous with the serving of tofu. Dessert - Green Tea Jelly. Quite refreshing.

As for your second question, I didn't quite get you. Care to explain? Last year on a flight from Singapore to London, they served the dish ""Bubble and Squeak"". That's a typical English meal. I think if you serve this meal on a flight to Paris or Zurich nobody would order this meal because it's too strange and too unknown for French, Swiss or other people. So, I think they adjust to every country. Probably that's why they serve different food on every route. "

Getting late BTC requests in,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7372-/page1," I have to say I have been very impressed with SQ's ability, and willingness, to accept late BTC requests. A couple of months ago I was in the Paragon PPS lounge late one afternoon sorting out a booking and realised I hadn't BTC'd a flight the following morning. I asked about ordering and she said it's within the 24 hour limit and even though the system told her so, she put a request in. I was pleasantly surprised to have the LSS come over shortly after boarding to confirm my Gyo-don. Last week I managed to go one better than this. I was in the new ION lounge at around 2pm and was travelling on that evenings SQ235 to BNE leaving at 21:10. Again I realised I hadn't BTC'd (I know I know, but I had only just confirmed which flight I was on a few days earlier..) so asked could she do it for me. She again said 'computer says no' but would put a request in. Lo and behold my Gyu-don was on my SQ235 just seven hours later. Very impressive. "
Getting late BTC requests in,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7372-/page1, I'm impressed indeed... I got one in just over midnight (early Friday morning) for a Friday evening SIN-BKK (back when it was still around)... but I've also missed one with 11 hours to go... SQ loves MAN Flyer

Anyone flown SQ638 in R lately?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/4461-/page1," I am grounded. But for the past years when I am taking SQ638, I always did the BTC because the BTC choices were exactly like for dinner. If I decided not to eat, or just had the simple meals from the menu, I would ask the cabin crew to have my BTC rack of lamb or the rib-eye steak. "
Anyone flown SQ638 in R lately?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/4461-/page1," The past menu that is posted above listed the Kaiseiki as main course for supper. That was what I wanted anyway, so maybe I will go for the Lobster Thermidor. And be greedy and have the Kaiseiki as well if I don't have enough! And then have the bak kut teh for breakfast as well. Hey, I might as well milk it for as much as its worth right? "

Anyone flown SQ638 in R lately?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/4461-/page1," Honestly premium classes are wasted on me.. as I don't (can't) drink champagnes and white wines. I used to be able to but now am quite allergic to whites and don't know why. Took SQ 638 and the meal was almost exactly the same as the inaugural flight which Carfield took a few months back except that my supper option only offered the Kaiseki meal. See: Here But I had my BTC Lobster - which was not all that hot. In taste and temperature! And I also asked for the Kaiseki to be served for breakfast. I was honestly disappointed with the kaiseki to be honest. Is that it? Is it the same for all flights? Or are supper portions smaller than regular day flights? Cos I have had better Kaiseki's on CX, JL in their F classes, and even on AC's J! "

In this post - is this chicken or duck? The post title says duck, the message says it's the Japanese chicken, it looks more like the duck though... Interesting also to see the decline between the two monkfish shots ex-LHR in Nov 05 and Feb 07! Hiya PhilH Good to see a BA Board member here. Warm personal welcome. Glad to see you have searched (SQFAN ducks from flames ) The first dish was chicken. Hmm, I still can taste it now. Indeed, there was a decline in the monkfish presentation wise and in terms of taste, albeit slightly. Since you like seafood, you asked about Lobster and Monkfish. Personally , I would go for Monkfish. I find and feel that using cheese in the Lobster tends to over-power the natural taste of the lobster. The chinese style of cooking (spring onion and ginger) is more subtle and the flavours of the lobster enhanced. It's a matter of personal taste at the end of the day. Hope this helps. Enjoy your SQ BTC and do report back. As LSS say with a smile; when she present your food to you ""Enjoy"". "
BTC planning,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3135-/page2," Just to add about the Japanese Ducken.... I would like to take you on a magical trip of the pictured Japanese teriyaki plate. Please, no one, find any offense in my comments as there is none intended. Also pictured on the plate are carrot, sato-imo, sh!take mushrooms, fried tofu the combination of which is often called ""nimono"". All those and many other ingredients when put together and stewed(or boiled)with a shoyu based sweet sauce (aka teriyaki) are called nimono. This kind of dish is a regular on most tables in Japan and is often found during a kaiseki meal when it appears as a Kobachi in a small serving dish. This kind of dish can also be found in bento boxes. Another favorite of mine is dried/reconstituted daikon radish and carrot in a julienne style which is also served with the same sauce above. With regards to the sauce, each regions sauce(teriyaki) will taste different. All use the same basic ingredients of Shoyu, sugar, mirin, sake and some fish stock(but not always) but in various amounts. The teiyaki sauce where I live is noted for it's strong taste(Kyushu) where as somewhere like Kyoto will have a very light taste. There is also a variance between households. Japanese food is generally not served on one plate, but in many dishes. So if the above were to be served in Japan one would no doubt see the rice, nimono, chicken served seperately and no doubt including a bowl of soup! This would follow the tradition that a standard meal comprises three okazu and is termed ichijū-sansai (一汁三菜; ""one soup, three sides""). I hope this was informative in some way....... "

Duck is not a big seller here and have not seen it too often on regular menus. The portion size and presentation would also be different (figure 1/2 sized portions as pictured above) with other okazu. In fact the last time I ate duck was at a farmers house where they had a celebration of the harvest last November. They are natural farmers and use ducks to kill pests in the paddies. That seasons ""Aigamo"" ducks were served with the new harvest of whole grain rice. "

Even the J class crew will rush to Y to help out with the service after completing the J service! Once, I only got my meal halfway through descent and the tray was collected less than 5 mins later when the flaps were already down!! And many a times, the crew could not finish serving the whole cabin and i think that is one of the reason that SQ changed the service to a hot snack instead. "

But really, nasi lemak has many different version. Malay style would be different from Singapore style. And I know there is a similar one from Indonesia. Yes, I recalled I had one in southern part of thailand which they considered it as local dish as well. What's the definition of authentic nowdays? I remember those days when I visited Amsterdam too often, there was a Thai restaurant at the red light district that serves excellent Thai food which my Thai friends agreed completely. I find chicken curry peranakan is good enough being served on board the plane. And I know you may say curry from MH would be better! And yes, I do remember those posts about how everyone prefers Malay or MH satays. Again, there are so many kinds, and yes, I do like Indonesian satays. Well everything is back to what you are looking for. Definitely if you spend your time in South East Asia, I would eat the local dishes in the local restaurant to enjoy the most. And I will not be too worry about the food on board my flight. I generally pick asian dishes because I prefer that than the western food. I did venture to gnocchi, pappardelle etc, but it did not set well with me. One time I modified my own meals on board SQ. I had rack of lamb. The crew had cut chilli and I had my tiny bottle sweet soya sauce. Had mix those as well as the onions from the satay... and yes I had rack of lamb marinated with chilli sweet soya sauce like an Indonesian satay. "

Indeed sorry Mods if I take this thread OT momentarilly - I'll be sure to return it to normal programming in due course... Kyo, you're right on the money there mate both in regards to Marlborough being associated with all things Sauvignon Blanc in NZ and the 'pedigree' or lack thereof of Cloudy Bay being served in the F cabin... I'm not privy as to how these wines are selected and/or road tested - or should I say 'air' tested - think Heston Blumenthal's 'Mission Impossible' TV series where in one episode he ventures aboard BA to help improve their menu - does that kind of thing take place with airlines? It should IMHO... I would think that as a part of the whole 'experience' of flying up the front, the food and beverage that is served needs to enhance that 'experience'.. A good example of a well put together wine list, QF, I use QF as the example as this is the only other airline I've flown long-ish haul in the pointy end. The wine list is well put together and invites the passenger on a journey of sorts in choosing a wine. I also understand that EY specifically employ 'In Flight Sommeliers' to enhance their wine offerings but from what I've seen from a few trip reports by Carfield (if I'm not mistaken - and my apologies if I am) I'm not too sure how involved that particular job is. But back to my gripe about Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc, and as I mentioned earlier I'm by no means a fan of NZ Sauvignon Blanc (in all honesty every time I smell one, there's always a hint of ""cats piss"" lingering and it turns me off - it's something you don't find in Australian and Californian Sauvignon Blancs of comparable quality) there are a number of excellent ones out there, but because the market is so bastardised by cheap and nasty ones these higher quality, hard to find, diamond in the rough types get overlooked. Price may play a larger factor than one might like but being the premium cabins you would think that that factor shouldn't be that large. Afterall the champagne's being served are right up there and even the red wine offering is interesting. It is simply IMHO that those of us out there who do enjoy a good white wine shouldn't be overlooked or subjected to such miserly offerings by such a prestigious airline such as SQ (That's right, I went there! I used one of those words like 'prestigious' ) when we're flying premium. /RANT "
SQ First Menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/68-/page28," I found your rant well thought out and interesting, and as you say, it boils down to individual preference. As long as SQ keeps the Bordeaux and Burgundies flowing, I ain't complaining as I still prefer a fine, full-bodied French offering over DP or Krug I may not be even really into the whites, but have been known on occasion to try some on NZ flights (and all their crew will rave about/recommend the Sauv Blancs if you ask for recommendations) "

BTC in J ex-MEL recommendations?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5344-/page1," Some options and questions from a BTC newbie. All opinions valued. The following options appeal to/interest me: 1. Chicken in macadamia nut crust with bush tomato coulis, roast vegetables, and new potatoes 2. Grilled beef in green peppercorn sauce with seasonal vegetables and gratin potatoes 3. Pan-fried barramundi in native pepper sauce with sautéed vegetables and fettuccine 4. Wok-fried rice with tender pieces of marinated chicken, egg, and spring onion Just a few questions: a. Any idea how the preparation of the chicken in macadamia nut crust dish is? I can't imagine what the nut crust is like. Is this something like chicken schnitzel in a tomato based sauce? b. Is the grilled beef a steak or beef slices? c. I note from this thread that the ex-SYD barramundi isn't very good. Is this due to the taste of the dish (black bean sauce) or how the barramundi is cooked in general? I imagine meat like fish and beef to be pretty hard to cook just right usually, so should I risk ordering either on a plane considering it is just reheated? I do like pasta dishes, so will be inclined to order the fish. I did read somewhere that SQ beef is ok though, but this might be ex-SIN specific? "

I am usually wary of ordering meat BTC dishes because usually difficult for them to get it right, for example, the F class 8oz steak is completely dry with no juice.

Ticked me off a bit so next time I'll just skip any meals and go for more sleep. SQ could improve their timing for meals on many flights and give their passengers more time to rest. For short overnight flights, I usually order the Cajun Chicken Salad and reserve that for breakfast. As it doesn't need any pre-heating, the crew has a lot more flexibility in terms of timing. In First Class, they are usually good to serve after the captain made his announcement that descend has started which is 40 minutes into arrival. In Business Class, that's cutting it a bit short but you can still start having your meal 60 minutes before touch down. "

Then we won't miss SQ satay all that much Hey I was in KUL a couple of times last month... sorry I didn't see this post earlier! But I do agree, Malaysian satay overall beats Singaporean satay. Both in taste and definitely the $$ factor. In fact, I find satay served on MH plumper and juicier than SQ's equivalent. Plus the peanut sauce really is made with fresh crushed peanuts. I'm salivating as I write this from Calary ! "
Satay,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3270-/page4," Satay is 'poor' food - which is not a slight against it at all, but to me means that it suffers when made 'high end' with better cuts of meat and upsized into larger portions. Good satay for me is bite sized, fatty (thus jucier), accompanied with cukes, onions, ketupat and a soupy peanut gravy/sauce. SQ's is good, but not classic 'brings back memories' stuff. Best satay I've had is in M'sia as well. A colleague whisked me from my hotel in PJ and we did a late night run to Kajang just for satay. Delish! "
Satay,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3270-/page4," Best satay I have ever had is still in Indonesia and worst satay I ever had is at Newton Circle in Singapore (blame me for eating my satay there). In Indonesia, best satays come from the food cart and not those served in the restaurant. Talking about ""poor"" food, in Indonesia you do get them in very small bite pieces with different types of sauces of your choice from the Madura peanut sauce (Java and other islands), the Malay peanut sauce (cooked & soupy - mostly in North Sumatra and Riau), the Padangnese curry sauce, as well as just a simple onion and chile in kecap manis. And yes, ketupat or lontong is a must for satay or it won't be a satisfying meal. And yes, MH satay is way better than SQ satay in terms of juiciness and the consistency of the sauce. "

Not the case, had several of them over the years and taste went steadily downhill. It is just that the other options were few to find so many people ordered Western. some change here would have been nice too. Plus they got like 8-10 International chefs on that panel and they devised like what ??? 3 signature dishes in C BTC. WOW I'm impressed. The Swedish crisp bread breakfast option must have taken a lot of consideration. (Sorry I couldn't help myself here) Don't get me wrong, many of the changes such as menu expansion are welcome, but after so many years that was urgently needed. I'm hoping the food quality picked up again too, at least for C meals.

Shrinking Meal Portions in Business Class?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/12916-/page1," Is it just me or the meal portions in business class flights are getting smaller and smaller over the years? It seems most of the time, there are more condiments than actual food served on the plate. Was on an afternoon flight yesterday from Shanghai to Singapore and the main course I ordered, the seared chicken's portion was so tiny, I actually for the first time asked for a second meal. The air stewardess looked genuinely bewildered when I made the unconventional request. To her credit, she managed to conjure up a second serving despite a full flight. But again a tiny piece of lamb loin. I thought of asking for a third serving but decided not to. Think I will bring packeted food up next time or eat before I board. Just an observation. "

How fresh can meals onboard a plane be even if they were loaded at the point of departure? These would have been prepared in the factory kitchen some hours back, stored in freezers, then loaded at least 1 hour, if not longer, before departure, served 1 hour after departure and on long flights to EU, some 10 hours after take off ........ I guestimate of at least 6 hours of storage before the first meal is served at your table, whether Y, J or F and the second meal, at least 12 hours in storage before serving. On long flights, especially those that takes off in the night, I rather eat before boarding, have a drink and go to sleep. "

I would suspect so, as the taste has been quite consistent every time I've had it served. Presumably it is frozen or chilled somewhere on the plane. Since it is already cooked, it can be kept for a long period of time in the right conditions. "

The other day, i was talking to other SQ flyers who fly mainly to europe in Business. I was surprised to hear that satay served from destinations outside SIN is actually loaded onto cargo then heated up and served thereafter. Hmm, now this sets me thinking about SQ67 GRU-BCN-SIN I browsed through my pics again and there was satay ex-GRU (dinner) and ex-BCN (lunch). At the time, i thought wow - nice tender satay and it was so good (shook) to feel authentic flavouurs from home after a central/south american vacation. I was amazed that remote catering stations could get the satay so authentically flavoured and textured. Now it looks like the satay has actually flown SIN-BCN-GRU-BCN for almost 2 days before it gets served for lunch over Romania? And on the topic of shrinking portion in business class, I didnt notice it as recent as September (BLR and BKK routes). I thought portions were just right, and i could go all the way to dessert course. But I flew economy class again recently 2 weeks ago after a long absence and I was shocked at the amount of protein served: 2 bite-sized morsels of fish and a pile of rice that occupies more than half of the casserole. SQ has gone budget except for its fares "

I wonder what the opinions are if you spend over 6k in airfares to eat stale food or food that is brought over as cargo, then prepared and kept in cargo for 24 hours. I'm not from the airline industry, but my assumption would be that most hot dishes served inflight would be cooked, frozen and then stored for a long time before being reheated for serving. Once frozen after cooking, it seems that the food can be stored for a surprisingly long time while retaining its taste/texture. So I would not be surprised if the satay was cooked and frozen well in advance, before thawing and heating onboard prior to service. It would be the same for most other airline food. Besides, SQ has installed this at Changi Airport to prepare satay the traditional way... "

Many people do not like seafood and fish and some are also anaphylatic to many forms of seafood. (But then SQ's love of tossing around peanuts only 20 min into a long haul flight suggests they have little concern about anaphylaxis! But maybe the number of compulsory anaphylaxis training sessions work forces me to sit through has left me bitter and twisted ) So very often, one of the two meal options in Y is a fish offering. And on many such occasions, the last section of the plane to be served gets all the fish that the rest of the cabin didn't want, which leads me also to wonder why they get the balance of the two options so wrong, unless the catering companies operate on a '50/50 only' basis. I'm not a vegetarian and I eat practically everything but NOT fish and seafood. I know many other who are the same. I've been relegated to the fish option enough times to make me contemplate ordering vegetarian, but even though I love vegetables and am quite partial to tofu, I really don't want to potentially consign myself to tofu when so many of the SQ Y meals really are excellent for economy plane food. Is it acceptable passenger etiquette to catch a passing flight crew member after menu distribution and let them know in advance that you can't eat the fish option?

The seafood is usually in the appetizer e.g. smoke salmon. Yes, they always have one non-fish mains option, but all too often the only option left for the last section of the cabin is the fish option because the other one runs out. I long for the day when I hear someone being told that the fish has run out and only the other one is left. Yes, seafood is often in the appetiser. This means that if all that's left when they get to me is a fish option for mains, then I cant eat either the main or the appetiser. I've had some really great crew experiences though. One offered once to try to rescue the chicken mains from someone who decided against eating. Sure enough they found one further up the cabin, untouched and sealed in foil where the passenger had lost their appetite. Much nicer than the QF response- slapping a chilled sandwich down on the tray and making a huge sigh then turning away. And they wonder why Australians don't fly QF anymore... "

The following is what I had on my recent SQ flights. SQ184 on 25 Mar 2015: Seafood Meal - Fish fillet with noodles. Very hard and had the distinct taste of processed food. SQ183 on 27 Mar 2015: Seafood Meal - Seafood balls and shrimp with pasta. This was much much better than the outbound dish. The shrimp was very fresh. I loved it. SQ185 on 21 Apr 2015: Standard Meal - Fish fillet with pasta. Very good. The Caucasian lady beside me loved it too. This wasn't a Seafood Meal but I thought I'd share for comparison.

I was in the SKL this month waiting for my plane home to LHR when I decided to eat cereal. I swear they were fruit loops and tasted great but when I got back to London and ordered fruit loops of the internet they looked nothing like the version in the skl. The kellogs fruit loops i got are brightly coloured and not very tasty whereas the SKL ones are slightly muted in colour and very tasty (could be due to the full fat milk i tried it with but i digress) Any help would be appreciated, they were in the twisty handle container next to the bran flakes for reference. Thanks, Sean "

It is no longer served in the shell. It is basically lobster meat tossed in the sauce. The portion was larger but the quality *imo* was substandard.

First, let me start off by saying that I am really excited to fly on SQ for my very first time. I am long time CO FF (I have been a member since the early days of ONEPASS) and I was able to redeem some of my CO ONEPASS miles for my first (and hopefully not last) SQ F experience. I was able to redeem one seat in F on SQ11 and SQ12 LAX-NRT-LAX respectively for dates in mid November. I searched both SQTalk and Flyertalk and it looks as if the Lobster is no longer a good option for BTC ex-LAX. Thus, I am considering the Veal chop for my lunch and the Pheasant with stuffed Blini for my pre-arrival light meal. Are these good choices or should I consider something else? Lastly, I understand that if I prefer something off the regular menu for the day of flight, as long as every other passenger's order has been fulfilled, I can request something else if available, is that correct? Again, thank you for your insight and knowledge, Dan "

BTC selection help,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5584-/page3," Thank you for your warm welcome! I spoke with a good Flyertalk friend of mine who seemed to feel the Lobster while not what it once was, is still acceptable and maybe even good when compared to many other dishes. He also seemed to feel that the Veal Chop would be a big disappointment as it was tasteless and of poor quality. Is my friend accurate or was he being overly generous to SQ's LAX flight kitchen with regards to the Lobster and too tough on them with regards to the Veal Chop? He also mentioned the Beef Sukiyaki as an option for the second meal, but I figured that since I am going to Japan, I would enjoy it more in a terrestrial based restaurant. Dan "

Rarely, I have found that an airline can prepare red meat properly, CO does fairly well with some of their red meat preparations, although, even they fail a good portion of the time.

I do enjoy Lobster, however, if it is sub-par which it seems to be from reading this board and Flyertalk, than I am really not interested. I have read that the Chilean Sea Bass (aka the Patagonian toothfish) is pretty good, however, it is one of the few types of fish that I really dislike. With regards to the Beef Sukiyaki, I enjoy the dish, and if it is that good, maybe I should consider it. Honestly, I just want to enjoy my SQ experience to the fullest and by trying to pick the right dishes, I hope that I can partly accomplish that goal. Dan "

NH is probably the best...and they cook the raw meat to order. Counting the upcoming SQ flights, this is going to by my fourth transpacific crossing on a non-US flag carrier (I have made many Transpac crossings on CO, NW). My mind is boggled by the idea of the raw meat being prepared in-flight from its raw state. I know that CO's cooking procedure for most red meat dishes calls for barely cooking the meat in the flight kitchen and then cooking it the rest of the way in-flight to try and ensure that each and every piece comes out medium to medium well. In the real world, this process works fairly ex-CO hubs where CO owns their own flight kitchens, but is far more hit or miss at their outstations where they do not own their flight kitchens and therefore lack the oversight to ensure that each and every procedure is adhered to 100%. Ex-CO hubs I am to exploit this procedure by requesting the FA (in the nicest way possible, generally, this requires a bribe of chocolates or some other form of food) to cook my piece of red meat for far less time than the the instructions call for. The outcome, a piece of red meat that is medium rare to even rare (on some RARE occasions).

Current SQ235 Y catering/service-info?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13324-/page1," Hello I'm curious as to if anyone here can provide any info on the current catering (menus)/service SQ provide on SQ235 (dep. 21:15 from Singapore to Brisbane)? My parents are currently on a 3 day stop-over in Singapore, on their way to Australia from Europe. I helped them book their tickets, and kinda steered them towards flying SQ, based mainly on the level of inflight service in Y. However, after just reading on airreview.com I am under the impression that the only meal they will be served after their evening departure will be a small sandwich (http://www.airreview.com/Singapore/Food.htm). I have found some of the info on that site to be outdated, so would very much like any updated/current info, just so I know if I should advise them to have a more substantial meal at Changi before departure. I tried searching the forum, but couldn't find any real current info. Thanks "

But I guess being a vegetarian always limits the choice of getting a good selection of food unless you are in India. Then again, it would be mostly curry oriented there. Tung Lok group in Singapore actually runs a good (Chinese) vegetarian restaurant and since Sam Leong is one of the chefs used by SQ, I just wonder why SQ does not work with Sam on this one. "

Good idea, but you know SQ is still under ""public + private"" governance, normally when you do such feedback, it will involve multiple parties and take forever to resolve. At most, within 2-3 days, they will get an Administrative Officer to draft a standard sorry template and send to you , signed off by a name of a manager. I think the best way is to escalate and get the VP to look into this matter, but I don't know who is the right person. Any suggestion? "

Desserts are selected from the tray with an assortment of the desserts. On the menu, the choice of desserts are Apricot Flan, Raspberry Truffle or cheese with crackers. This one is still ok. Desserts 2 - Is this supposed to be the raspberry truffle? No real raspberry fruit, and did not taste any raspberry in it. It is only some chocolate brownie type of cake. Taste of chocolate is not bad (well, how bad can the taste be when there is chocolate), but it is not some good quality cakes that is light and fluffy. Cheese.

Anyway T2's SKL F is also interesting in its own way... "

How many meal on SQ 317,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/4679-/page1," If you consider the food you may have pre-flight in the lounge, then the welcome drinks onboard, the satay, the first meal (appetizer, salad, main, desert, fruits, cheese & crackers, chocolates), the in-between-meals fruits, snacks, sandwiches, then the pre-arrival breakfast, you'll be full even ...before get your boarding pass in your hands... The food is quite a bit, not in this flight only (which incidentally I haven't done), but to any SQ J long-haul flight. Best is what Kapitan said: have lunch, go to the lavatory and change to your pajamas (believe me, you won't regret it, I do it every time now, even for 5-6 hr flights), have a nice sleep, wake up for breakfast...

How many meal on SQ 317,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/4679-/page1," skooby, I sympathize with you that your bodyclock isn't easy to fool. I assume you'll be on London time? I can never get a decent amount of sleep on SQ317 because my body thinks it's supposed to be awake for most of the flight. Having said that, I think the snack options can be rather substantial in Business Class; they go beyond just fruit, crisps and chocolate bars. I recall one time when the wrap contained what seemed like the equivalent of the satay chicken. (It was also served warmed ). There are also noodle soups on offer. You won't be limited in the number of snacks you ask for, so just ask whenever you start feeling peckish. From my experience, two C class snacks easily made up for the 'missing' meal. Have a decent breakfast (meal #1) on the ground [that's what I used to use the VS CH for]; you'll have the full C class lunch onboard; two snacks to tide you over; and then you have the breakfast, which can be rather substantial as well. Consider this last meal a very late dinner. "

Just my mindset is that since myself or my company has paid the price for a F ticket, one should be entitled to keep the menus as the price of the ticket more than enough covers the cost of one leather and menu printing materials. "

I never ask to keep the menus either, but then again I have no interest in keeping the menus so have never taken one. "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2," I always take the menus from every flight, and I never ask-- unless the FA comes and asks me for it directly, in which case I say I'd like to keep it as a souvenir. Taking the F leather menu cover is farther than I'm willing to go. Then again, I have a fondness for blankets from Raffles Class (and Business Class on certain other airlines). But if asking for the menus yields other nice little bennies like playing cards to add to my collection, maybe I should start doing that... "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2," Is the menu-gathering still in force? On my last flights in December-January, I didn't see the FAs trying to take the menus back. "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2," I had this dilemma last night, and have just found this thread! I eventually took the paper menus out of the leather folder and then put them in my bag. Shortly before landing, as the cabin crew were preparing the cabin, the senior attendant came along and took away the leather folder, but didn't look inside. That was that, so I've still got them. But based on that one occasion, they do still try and collect them before landing. "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2," Yes, I still see the FAs would collect the menu. But not diging or checking the binder. Took the paper menu out, that' what I did. In my NW28, the FA took away the menu that she saw. But instead of collecting them and piled them nicely, she just threw in everything in the white garbage bag. Must be going to recycling center, presumably. In CX712 SIN-HKG, the FA also looked for the menu in the seat pocket. But I had mine tucked away already. "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2," Menus I actually got to keep the brand new menus with the leather cover on my SQ 861/77W flight. The F/As did not actually make the usual menu gathering round, and nowaday, I don't make it a secret that I take the menus home. I assume the F/As know that I am into airline ""food"" as I am taking vairous pictures of the meals, and not surprised that I want to take the menus home. I honestly think that SQ F/As know that most folks up front pay big bucks and that menus really don't cost too much for SQ. They are sometimes worried that you are a ""spy"" from other airlines...

Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2, Seems like TG staffs are those often with suspicions... They suspected me and shortfinals as SQ staffs when we checked out their A345. 
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2, yes i experienced the same treatment on TG from MXP to SIN last spring. The FAs was really suspicious after seeing me taking pictures and reported it to Purser. 
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page2," On my last 77w flight in F... When the FA came around to collect the menus before landing, I politely asked if I can keep the menu.. usually they look shocked and change their expression when I tell them I just want the paper menu inside... To my surprise, on that flight, she just said ok and handed me the whole thing, including the new style leather cover, etc... Maybe they don't want those anymore.. or she just forgot to take it back?

SQ feedback:No caviar if you BTC??,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/15050-/page1," This post follows on from my previous post in which only one portion of caviar was loaded on SQ 318 on 21/6/2018, with a full component of 4 passengers. I have now received feedback from SQ. They tell me that: 1. The caviar was not offered to me as a starter because I ordered the BTC lobster for my main and did not order the standard meal!! 2. They tell me they only loaded one portion for the passenger who had the standard meal (presumably did not use the BTC) 3. They also tell me that if I want caviar on my return F flight from CPH to SIN on 8/7/2018, then I need to cancel my BTC order, which, by the way is only the Japanese BREAKFAST! This means that, unlike stated on any web page, they have begun penalising passengers who order BTC and not loading caviar as the appetiser for these passengers, which sounds bizarre. It is hard to imagine this explanation being correct, but let me know if I am mistaken. I have always been offered the caviar service in addition to BTC, as recently as Jan 2018 when I flew the new A380 suites out of Sydney and used BTC for the lobster If it is, be aware that you may not be offered caviar if you BTC Their response is particularly incomprehensible as caviar is a starter or appetiser and you cannot use BTC for an appetiser Im interested in your response "
SQ feedback:No caviar if you BTC??,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/15050-/page1," In such cases, you would need to be stern in your reply and state factually that there is no written conditions which states that caviar service is not available for BTC meals, and that BTC is only applicable for the main course and not the starter. Through my experiences, many a times, the person who replies the feedback has no clue of the service procedures onboard. "

After a few email exchanges in which I was assertive about the BTC historically being SEPARATE to the starter courses, I finally received an email from SQ acknowledging that a mistake had been made in not loading the caviar. They have also rectified the error of initially informing me thatI had to cancel my order of the Japanese breakfast on the CPH-SIN flight, in order to have the caviar for the lunch service on this flight. They were gracious in their (final) apology. It is still a mystery that the BTC option for the CPH flight has disappeared (it only ever had the Japanese breakfast as an option but this has disappeared too!!) I will report back on the CPH flight Thanks again "

SQ feedback:No caviar if you BTC??,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/15050-/page1," I'm relieved that it's an error rather than a policy change! Also, that's an appalling initial response attempting to deflect the issue. I love the Bak Kut Teh and hazelnut veal; they're my go-tos on the BTC menu and more often than not I BTC so that I know my main course will at least be edible, but enjoy starting the meal with caviar even more. That said I believe there are instances when a BTC order will eliminate the offering of caviar (and indeed most other items on the regular menu). I remember BTC'ing a Japanese box meal (it had a Japanese name starting with K...) on a SIN-MEL, which turned out to be way more comprehensive than your standard main course - it was a complete meal in itself with starters and sweets, and as I was the only passenger in First they didn't load any other foods on to the plane except the bread plate. There was literally nothing else, not even cheese. It was disappointing as I had planned on some caviar for brunch and always end the meal with cheese and port. I understand why they wouldn't bother loading any other items in that scenario but had I known I'd have ordered a more 'standard' BTC meal. At least they still had the regular drinks list and I wasn't stuck with sake... #thankgodforsmallmercies Since then I've avoided any BTC options that look like they're anything more than a regular main course!

People creating headlines far from the trutht and then other people start spinning the rumour mill. Sad for someone who has been around for some time... I did read every post in this thread before mine... No, I'm not one of those forum users who read the first post and fire away. It was my reading of SQ's response that made me decide I won't use BTC in First Class... SQ's customer service initially told him that he won't get caviar if he used BTC and it took several email exchanges before they admitted to it being a ""mistake"". I qualify this is my own analysis of the information provided, but it seems to me that this is yet another cost-cutting effort by SQ by the fact that they first gave an elaborate explanation that one wouldn't get caviar if he/she used BTC, and then try to cover it when cornered by saying it was all an error. They're likely to do that again- loading less caviar on a flight if a passenger BTC-ed, hoping that passenger wouldn't ask for caviar if he/she wasn't offered any. I only have one flight in F this year so I'm not taking my chances! "
SQ feedback:No caviar if you BTC??,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/15050-/page1," Feedback It is true that the exchanges relied heavily on me to correct matters of fact in multiple ways before I was validated and my gripe acknowledged (I started one response with ""I do not accept your explanation""). This was taken to the extent of being asked to cancel my BREAKFAST Japanese meal on this (return) fight so that I could be served caviar for lunch! It still remains a mystery as to why this solitary BTC breakfast option on this flight has disappeared since. However, it is also true that all airlines are cutting catering/wine costs (including pour quantity in some cases). As always, one must balance a sense of entitlement with assertiveness. I also get that not everyone places an emphasis on the food and wine on board (as I do). "

According to the brilliant winemaker-in-chief Richard Geoffroy, quality is based on harmony, a perfect blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes where nothing is lost and everything comes together. The 2000 vintage shows the proof of this to perfection Krug Grande Cuvee Founded in Reims in 1843, the House of krug is now managed by the 5th and 6th generations of the Krug family. Rigorous selection and care go into every detail of the multi-vintage Grande Cuvee, which offers a magical combination of aromatic complexity, power and finesse with a long, lingering finish. Krus is the ultimate experience in champagne. White wines Rudesheismer Riesling Spatlese 2006 Rheingau Balthasar Ress The family-owned Ress Estate dates from 1870 and is one of the most important in Germanys famous Rheingau region. Above the little town of Rudesheim on the river Rhine the Riesling vines grow on steeply terraced south-facing slopes, whose rocky barren soils originating from quartz and slate always provide outstanding natural ripeness and concentration. Showing a lemon yellow colour, white flower aromas with a hint of honeysuckle and fresh limes, soft summer fruits on the palate and a refreshing acidity that balances the touch of sweetness, the 2006 vintage, small but of excellent quality, is now simply delicious Beaune Du Chateau Premier Cru 2006 Bouchard Pere Et Fils Bouchard Pere et Fils are one of the largest owners of Premier Cru vineyards in Burgundy and their holdings are partiularly prestigious around the historic town of Beaune. This wine is picked, fermented and matured in small oak barrels, which adds complexity to the aromas of white flowers and the purity of fruit that the white wimes of Beaune are famous for. 2006 was a great vintage and shows great elegance and persistence of flavour. Red wines Chateau Pichon-Longueville Au Baron De Pichon-Longueville 1998 Pauillac The senior of the two famous Pichon-Longueville estates, both of which created Second Growths in the 1855 Classification, contains a high (62%) proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon vines amongst its 73 hectares of sparse, gravely soil. When blended with the softer Merlot and the aromatic Cabernet Franc grapes, it produces a wine that is sought by collectors all over the world. Neighbours to the estate is First Growth Chateau Latour and the wines share a similar deep fruit personality with a hint of cedar wood on palate and a firm finish. 1998 was an excellent vintage in Bordeaux, one of the very best of the decade which, now in its tenth year, has reached a peak of quality. Castello di Fonterutoli 2004 Chianti Classico The hamlet of Fonterutoli near Castellina in Chianti, with its imposing castle, has been in the Mazzei family since 1435. Already one of the most famous of Chiantis, the Mezzei decided from the excellent 1995 vintage to separate the Castello or chateau wine from the generic Chianti that would be simply named Fonterutoli. Made from 7 different clones of the prized local Sangiovese grape, with 10% Carbenet Sauvignon, both aged for 18 months in new French oak, Castello di Fonterutoli represents Chianti Classico at its very best. The splended 2004 vintage possesses a deep colour and an intensity of fruit that is now beginning to show true character and complexity. Port Dows 20 Year Old Tawny Port, Portugal "

Its her first time in C and i really wanted to give her a great experience. I could only afford the saver award for both of us so there was only 1 flight choice SQ231 on the 744. I heard later that there have been flights out at midnight that won't give you the full C class experience. I called SQ to confirm that we would be getting supper and brekky but unfortunately NO! Depart 0030 and arrive 1100! Arrive 1100 and no brekky? Anyone know if supper is at least a full plated meal service with 3 courses? I was hoping to for a really good experience....cos its my wife's first time. I know i sound damn loser to those who are paying C and F pax but for peasants like me, this an exciting thing to do. Anyone flown this flight in C and know what the menu will be like? Thanks in advance! Also feel free to add those services you know are similar so peasants like me don't get disappointed again.... "

Flights that don't give you the FULL SQ catering experience,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5653-/page1," Unfortunately, that flight after midnight had become a one meal service only as a sleeper service. This is the sample of the menu from last year. Originally posted by Nick C View Post menu To allow you a longer period of undisturbed rest, please let us know your preference for the following meal service options: - To be served your meal soon after take-off OR - To be served your meal about 2 hours before arrival To Start With A choice of apple, tomato or freshly squeezed orange juice The Main Event Singapore nasi lemak Malay style coconut rice with spicy prawns, peanuts, ikan bilis, grilled fish cake, egg omelette and fried chicken A local favourite served with sambal chilli Warm focaccia with chicken, pesto spread and fontina cheese, grilled vegetables Braised rice vermicelli with scallops, prawns, fish and leafy greens American Breakfast Fruit yoghurt Poached egg with bacon, sauteed spinach, tomato and potatoes Bread selection with preserves Continental Breakfast Assorted bread with preserves Prawn noodle soup Noodles in broth served with prawn and fish cake Your meal will be served with a selection of sliced fresh fruits A Connoisseur's Choice Gourmet coffee Selection of tea SQ231A SIN-SYD (CM1) 28-1.1 07 RC Yes it has been a big debate among us here regarding this kind of meal service. But from the SQ point of view, the feedback that they receive is the fact that many pax prefer to sleep longer. Thus just one meal only whether after taking off or before landing to allow pax has a longer service. This is what I can suggest for you to enjoy more your C experience with your dearest wife. Go early to the airport. Enjoy T3. And go to SKL. Yes you are in C. So you can wait for your flight at SKL C Lounge which you know already. You can have your dinner there. I know some of SQTalkers here really dislike this place but for me it's pretty decent for fulfilling my appetite. Make sure you have your BTC ordered at least 24 hours prior. So when you are on board, you will have something more substantial than what showed in the sample menu above. If you get a great crew, you may even be able to have something after taking off, and have the BTC for your brekkie. Of course it's not always successful depending on many invisible factors, but I know I had experienced the magic work of having two meals for a red eye flight. "

I did recently BTC on a different supper service flight. Everything is the same per the supper menu except that the main course is replaced with the BTC dish of your choice. You still have the option whether to be served after takeoff or prior to arrival. I tend not to BTC for lunch/dinner service flights as I like to see what meal choices are offered. However, given the relatively poor/light main course options for the supper service flights, I highly recommend making a BTC selection beforehand. "

Interesting that you should ask, Kyo! This BTC choice didn't exactly go according to plan. In a rare service lapse (though admirably recovered later on...), I had gone to the restroom while starters were being served in J meal service, and when I returned to my seat, the cabin crew immediately served my main course, not realizing that I had not yet been served my starter. Back to the galley my main course went, and my starter came with profuse apologies. Later, when I was done with my starter, my main course came. And you can guess what happened next. My guess is that the cabin crew dutifully popped my main course back into the oven to keep warm, until my starter was done. When it came to me, and I sliced it open, it was cooked dry on the inside, well done to a brown, cardboard-like consistency, which was a pity, since it looked perfect on the outside the first time it was brought round. At that point, I was a little disappointed, and chewed through a few dry bites before leaving the rest untouched. Later when they came to pick up my main, the stewardess saw my half-eaten main, and asked if there was something a matter with the dish. I mentioned that I found it overcooked (In a polite way, of course...I don't believe in rants...), and she immediately offered to give me another main. ""Yes please, any other main will do!"" They brought me the other steak selection on the regular J menu, which was a perfect, moist, pink and tender on the inside -- which I thoroughly enjoyed. I was happy again and gave them a thumbs up next time they came round to check on me. More on that in an upcoming TR (Yes, Mrs yflyer and I were back in Seoul again last week!). As a preview of the next TR on Seoul, which can probably be considered a sequel to this one, Mrs yflyer's challenge, which she lamented to me was: ""8 meal slots on this trip and 9 places I want to try..."" More on that here :-) So, no opinion on how this BTC dish tasted this time round, although I would give it the benefit of the doubt and order it again, mainly on account of the chimmi-churri sauce, which was quite tasty. But brilliant service recovery on SQ, as always. "

There, it was served with soy sauce and not chili, which is bizarre. For chicken rice, it's all in the chili. I am not sure what chili they use for this onboard meal.

SQ Y Catering to Jakarta,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13722-/page1," Flew to Jakarta earlier this week. Had breakfast SIN-CGK and dinner CGK-SIN. Both meals very good. On both these sectors, you had a choice of either an Asian selection or a Western selection. Breakfast SIN-CGK on SQ956 (9.25am departure)... Dinner CGK-SIN on SQ963 (6.10pm departure), Asian-style chicken in a mildly spicy sauce with rice... You had a choice of red/white wine, beer or soft drinks (and tea/coffee) to accompany your meal. Even on this very short sector, with a scheduled time 1 hr 45 min, actual flight time closer to 1 hr 20 min, they had a full range of beverages available. I asked if they had a gin & tonic available (It was a tough work day -- I badly needed a drink), and they brought it to me a few minutes later. Great catering for such a short sector! On a related topic, both sectors were flown on SQ's 777's with current regional J seat (2-2-2), and refitted 9-abreast Y seat (brown seat covers over the old blue Y seats). "
SQ Y Catering to Jakarta,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13722-/page1," With CGK being a high-yielding station and with a huge loyalty base, SQ needs to maintain its standards as the preferred international carrier from CGK.

SQ Y Catering to Jakarta,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13722-/page1, I have always found the food in Y & J (never flown F) very good compared to other airlines. However I do find the food in Y is not enough for myself and im still hungry afterwards.

SQ Y Catering to Jakarta,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13722-/page1," According to my cousin (who used to work as SQ stewardess), the food comes from the departing airport (the galley only have that amount of space to store those food). It is double-catered only when something happened to the catering company in the airport (e.g. strike occur in CDG catering, hence they have no choice but to bring food for both ex-SIN and ex-CDG from SG catering). This means something have to be sacrificed... For short flights like CGK that provide light meals, I'm not sure if they double-catered though (forgot to ask about that). "
SQ Y Catering to Jakarta,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13722-/page1," CGK-SIN meals are catered ex-SIN (unless it is a night-stop flight, not sure if SQ does that in CGK). You can usually tell where the meal is catered from by the labels and covers on the water and orange juice, and sometimes even butter. I was in Jakarta just last week as well. Was on GA, and I must say that GA's meals are not inferior to SQ's on this short sector, in fact the GA tray had a little more content. "

Looking for BTC resommendations for SQ1,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5225-/page1," I will be on SQ1 in J in a few days and I am wondering if it worth it making a selection for the flight on BTC, or is it better to just order off the menu.

That is absolutely not true. I have in the past BTC in F & J where I have decided l like what is offered on the onboard menu and decide to forfeit the BTC for them and never have the crews made an issue about it. So unless in rare circumstances you get a bad/inflexible crew, you can always switch your BTC for something you see on the menu. For ex-SFO BTC options see here. "

Apart from the safe choice of omelette, SQ should be applauded for including a daring option: Korean-style spicy octopus. Daring for non-Koreans, anyway. They started service from the rear of the A330, so I got my choice of main, which was, of course, the octopus. A well filled casserole, with tentacles literally spilling over the edges... Delicious. The rice served onboard also deserves special mention: glistening short-grained rice with excellent texture. When I asked the cabin crew later how popular the octopus was, they said it was very popular on this flight, which had quite a few Korean pax on it. The fruit bowl was good too, with fresh cut orange, in addition to melon and watermelon slices. I also enjoyed the Apple Cream Cake for dessert. This was the only meal service on the 6 hour flight. They don't serve a pre-arrival snack on this sector. I am sure more than a few stomachs were growling as we prepared to descend into SIN. I got a little hungry an hour or so before boarding, and asked if they had noodles onboard. They did: Jumbo sized Korean instant cup noodles. If not for the noodles, I would have been quite hungry at the end of the flight. Thumbs up for stocking noodles! "

No to prawn octopus etc) for the past 10 years. Basically the japanese selection that is edible to me can be counted by finger (only 3 times so far), and it never got any fish in it (at least for me). Meaning everytime i choose the japanese selection, it is always chicken. Otherwise pork and beef are a big no for me. I've seen fish in the menu, but only for breakfast. Not sure if others have the same experience as me. Oh and one thing. If you can't stand dashi (fish stock), don't eat the soba as the dipping sauce is dashi-based. And i never ordered specialised menu (i.e. vegetarian meal etc). I just took a chance and if one of the menu is the one i can't it, i would notify the cabin crew that i am a semi-veggie and would like the edible menu to be reserved. "

Can't say this applies to everybody here but I have long (at least as an adult) dreaded airports and flying. I usually delayed getting to the airport till the last moment, skipped any lounge benefits, stared sadly at the same ol' movies on board and never BTC. After I chanced upon this forum, flying has taken on a new ""thrill"". Ok, heck - it is still not something I look forward to with excitement, but at least I make an effort to check out the different lounges at different airport, share experiences with others and simply create a bit of fun into a hitherto boring but necessary part of my life. Yup, I even checked if the nuts they served on board were nicely warmed (I took care to phrase this). Cheap thrill? Perhaps. Haha... "

I completely agree! Inflight food is never really that good. But part of the fun of flying is comparing meals with fellow travellers on a forum such as SQT, and admiring pictures of meals. I also like the SQ BTC local options - important to make the right choice (hence necessitating seeking the opinions of others on SQT) since that dish could be my last local food for a v long time until I go to SIN again.

Los Angeles Star Chef Suzanne Goin Joins Singapore Airlines' Int'l Culinary Panel,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10576-/page1," From singaporeair.com: Los Angeles Star Chef Suzanne Goin Joins Singapore Airlines' International Culinary Panel 30 June 2011 - One of America’s top-rated chefs, Suzanne Goin, has been named as the newest member of the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. The co-proprietor of celebrated Los Angeles restaurants Lucques, A.O.C. and Tavern, Suzanne joins a host of global food talents on the panel, including renowned French chef Georges Blanc and Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar & Grill in New York. Her menus will debut on SIA flights between Singapore and US cities from 1 August 2011. ""We are delighted to welcome Suzanne Goin as the newest member to our International Culinary Panel. We believe her talent and contribution will complement the existing expertise on the panel, and anticipate her inventive culinary creations, which I am certain will impress our customers,"" said Mr Tan Pee Teck, SIA’s Senior Vice President Product and Services. A deeply respected figure in the Los Angeles dining scene, Suzanne brings an inventive and distinctly Californian style to SIA’s inflight dining experience, with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients from local markets and purveyors, and preparations rooted in classic culinary traditions. Suzanne was named one of Food and Wine magazine’s “Best New Chefs” in 1999. In 2005, Suzanne’s cookbook, Sunday Suppers at Lucques, was published to great reviews. In 2006, the James Beard Foundation acknowledged Suzanne’s culinary achievements, first with the award for “Best Chef California” in 2006, and she subsequently received four concurrent nominations for “Outstanding Chef of the Year” from the Foundation between 2008 – 2011. Suzanne has served as the official caterer for the annual Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards for the past two years. Most recently, Suzanne was honoured to prepare a dinner for United States President Obama at Tavern during a recent official visit to Los Angeles. About Singapore Airlines’ International Culinary Panel: Singapore Airlines’ International Culinary Panel was set up in 1998. Comprising award-winning chefs of global stature, the Panel works closely with the Airline’s own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available for customers in all three classes on board. The Panel of internationally celebrated chefs currently includes Alfred Portale of the United States, Georges Blanc of France, Matthew James Moran of Australia, Sam Leong of Singapore, Sanjeev Kapoor of India, Suzanne Goin of the United States, Yoshihiro Murata of Japan, and Zhu Jun of China. http://www.singaporeair.com/jsp/cms/...s/ne110630.jsp "

I don't think each particular category warrants its own thread, but I do see how you'd think it'd make it alot easier to categorise. Will leave it to the mods to make that decision.. "
Muslim meal in SQ Y,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/8107-/page1," The muslim meals on SQ are generally very good.. Although I have no pictures, it's generally a rendang (beef with a somewhat dry curry sauce) with rice and a bit of veg. Other times I have had a prata (indian-muslim ""fried"" bread) with curry...

ST: The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11114-/page1," http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-...ry_738004.html The Straits Times www.straitstimes.comPublished on Nov 25, 2011 The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals By Myra Martin As Singapore Airlines' (SIA) manager of Inflight Services, Mr Hermann Freidanck spearheads the creation of 1,450 different dishes every four months and hones the balance between advance cooking and reheating of meals on board an aeroplane, while also anticipating the drying effects of cabin air which affects people's taste buds. No stone is left unturned, right down to the compartmentalised aluminium foil packaging of each dish before it is presented to a passenger on board. In short, Mr Freidanck scrutinises all aspects of food and beverage served on board all of SIA's flights. Even if one passenger is allergic to aluminium foil, as he received an outstanding special request recently, he personally will ensure that a suitable alternative packaging is given instead. He has been doing this and more at SIA, for the last 13 years. What distinguishes this 58-year-old German is his knowledge, expertise, systematic delegation, foresight, gumption and a career in hotel management spanning two decades, most of which was spent in Asia. That background helps him ensure quality inflight meals that meet the expectations of SIA's clientele, usually comprising 60 per cent foreigners and 40 per cent locals - which makes for a broad spectrum of tastes. Mr Freidanck said that 'everyone is contentious when it comes to specific ideas of how certain dishes should taste' because essentially, as he quipped so succinctly, 'my grandmother does a better char kway teow than yours'. He oversees not just the overall production of meals in Singapore, but also the 53 other catering stations in destinations across 63 cities. "
ST: The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11114-/page1," Mr Freidanck smiled wryly when he said he looks forward to Mondays at work. He said: 'My Mondays are spent looking at customers' complaints and feedback.' And still, despite all that obsessing, all we get are canned responses. [Pun absolutely intended... ] "

ST: The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11114-/page1," On a flight from SYD to SIN in Sept, my special meal request was somewhat incorrectly catered to. I wanted Oriental Vegetarian but as I'm also allergic to wheat products, asked for a SPML request - Oriental Vegetarian No Wheat. But I guess the Indian Call Centre was confused how to cater a SPML and just chose VOML. I got, you guessed it, vegetarian fried (wheat) noodles ! When I complained to the IFS, he carefully wrote down my request and said that he would pass info to SQ for the onward flight which was to BKK a few days later. I wasn't expecting any miracles but was pleasantly surprised when I received my VOML and gluten free bread at the same time ! Now that was indeed impressive especially for catering by SATS which isn't known for its culinary skills. I've yet to receive the same type of SPML since. "

ST: The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11114-/page1," At least now we know who is responsible for an evergreen Btc menu that never seems to change, and for then horrible green curry dish I had to endure from CDg to sin. Now who is accountable for the policy of under or just enough catering in FCL and JCL? :-p "
ST: The man who obsesses over SIA's inflight meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11114-/page1," A very long, long time ago, SQ experimented with an expert system (no, not artificial intelligence) to assist the head chef to plan menus for F pax. Because of the number of courses (from starters to desserts to wines) that need to be served, the sources of the food (where the food is uplifted from and what food was available and the know-how to cook it) and the number of flights SQ flew, this was quite a complex task for the chef to plan. He had to do this every few days to ensure there was variety. It was quite a first (pun intended), in the airline industry for a system like that back in the mid 80s. That was a fun project indeed. I have no idea what they do these days. Yes, cost controls would be right up there especially for Y class. "

Satay prelude disappears on some of my sectors?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7668-/page1," For sure menus change, but what is the general rule of thumb with the Satay prelude? Here are some examples based upon weekly sectors in J: Barcelona > Singapore SQ377 This is a daytime departing flight, orginally the lunch service from Milan onwards always had the satay prelude, then earlier in the year they dropped the prelude full stop? Why, the crew had no idea, suggesting SQ converted from a full lunch service to a brunch menu? Beijing > Singapore SQ805 Another sector I hammer on a regular basis yet as far as I can remember this always has Satay year after year? Any ideas, I always feel cheated without gorgeous plate of satay on a SQ flight.... "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page3," Menu cards Originally posted by MegatopLover View Post I always take the menus from every flight, and I never ask-- unless the FA comes and asks me for it directly, in which case I say I'd like to keep it as a souvenir. Taking the F leather menu cover is farther than I'm willing to go. Then again, I have a fondness for blankets from Raffles Class (and Business Class on certain other airlines). But if asking for the menus yields other nice little bennies like playing cards to add to my collection, maybe I should start doing that... Soon you can have all the menu cards! First, SQ asks you to check-in yourself online. Now they ask you to print your own boarding pass. Next, they will ask you to print your own menu cards. "
Keeping SQ menus,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/all-about-singapore-airlines/718-/page3, I actually have a copy of the Menu in my home from 2004 for the SQ227/SQ228 SIN-MEL-SIN services.Since I had a special meal prebooked I just collected the standard menu to see what the food looks like and to check out the drink choices They let me have it.It is a Raffles Class Menu by the way.The spare copy as there was no passenger next to me is in my Uncles House in Melbourne.

It has been a while since I have been served a proper steak in Y. Usually it is slices or chunks of beef. Not on this sector though. This is a proper beef fillet, done Japanese style, a creation of Culinary Panel chef Yoshihiro Murata, of Kikunoi, Kyoto. Cooked to a medium/well, but astonishingly tender. This is the overall meal tray (This is different meal tray, hence the slight difference in how the steak looks.) Potato salad starter... Cold soba... Ice cream for dessert. One of the best Y meals I have had in a long while. "

On SQ in J, I've had steaks nice and pink inside. That said for a Y meal, medium/well is probably the only way this dish can feasibly be served, as I suspect quite a few folks in our part of the world seem to like their meat well cooked, and will not eat anything that is red inside. It was very tender, though. "

The differentiation between them narrows the more you heat it. Go far enough, at a certain point (without even having reached the ""cinder blocks"" level) - they'll taste the same and have the same texture. Should that be one's preference: I've got a tip: No need to buy F class cut. Just buy a Y class cut and fire it to death and you'll save money. "

Some members of the board will inadvertently post menus of different flights they have been on.

Hope you are using what you receive as reference and not as a benchmark for expectation since the airline can alter the menu.

Latest Chef On International Culinary Panel Set To Thrill With Chinese Gourmet Deligh,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/6444-/page1," 24 April 2009 Singapore Airlines is delighted to welcome one of Chinas leading chefs, Zhu Jun (朱俊), as the latest appointment to its International Culinary Panel. To mark his introduction to the Panel, Chef Zhu has exclusively crafted an entire range of mouth-watering creations for Shi Quan Shi Mei (十全食美), Singapore Airlines signature inflight Chinese dining experience. First Class customers on Singapore Airlines flights from Beijing and Shanghai from 1 May onwards can look forward to this all-new lineup, which includes salad of chicken and jellyfish with cucumber, double-boiled soup with pine mushroom, and stir-fried sliced beef fillet with dried chilli. His dishes will also be available to Business Class and Economy Class customers as menu choices. Customers onboard flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, and San Francisco (via Hong Kong) will continue to enjoy the popular current Shi Quan Shi Mei choices, including dishes designed by Singapores very own Sam Leong, another world-class chef on the International Culinary Panel. Winner of Excellent Chef at the 15th China Chef Festival, Chef Zhus dishes carry his signature Shanghainese influence, with a dash of Sichuan, Huaiyang, Fujian, and Guangdong touches. His latest masterpieces and upcoming creations will no doubt tantalise the palates of many Singapore Airlines customers. Chef Zhu is currently the Vice General Manager and Executive Chef of Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering, one of Chinas leading restaurant chains, and an icon synonymous with elegance, quality and service excellence. Today, Jade Garden is widely known for its commitment to showcasing the best that Chinese cuisine has to offer. Chef Zhus masterful authority of the art of Shanghainese cuisine is one of the main factors in the establishment of the Jade Garden brand. We are pleased to welcome Chef Zhu as the latest member of our International Culinary Panel, and we look forward to his spectacular creations, which I am sure will please even the most sophisticated of tastebuds, said Senior Vice President Product and Services Mr Yap Kim Wah. He added: The International Culinary Panel has truly made an indelible mark on inflight dining, and the addition of Chef Zhu to this lineup of some of the worlds greatest chefs reflects the amazing diversity of international cuisine we serve our customers. Chef Zhu began his illustrious culinary career in 1988, under the masterful apprenticeship of Mr He Ji Sheng, a well-known Min cuisine chef. Early in his career, he also had exposure to classical French and Italian cooking, and this had a significant influence on his present unique style. Chef Zhus innovative approach to Chinese cuisine draws inspiration from his well-rounded experience, deftly combining elements of Western cuisine with the art of traditional Chinese cooking. This resulted in his well-received re-interpretations of numerous traditional Chinese favourites. Many of these new creations, such as Sliced Ham with Honey Sauce, Tea Smoked Duck, and Sautee River Shrimp, have all since become Jade Gardens signature dishes. Chef Zhus outstanding culinary artistry has won him many accolades from peers and the media, including being named Famous Chef of China by the China Cuisine Association in 2006, and being awarded China Golden Chef Elite Cultivation Award twice in 2006 and 2007. He is also currently the Director of Shanghai Cuisine Association. It is an honour to be in the company of such illustrious names on Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. Creating dishes for inflight dining is a unique experience for me, and I take enormous pleasure from meeting this challenge. I thoroughly enjoyed creating this new line of dining choices for Singapore Airlines customers, and I look forward to delighting them with more of my creations, said Chef Zhu. Chef Zhu will join seven other internationally-acclaimed chefs on the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel. These master chefs, all authorities in their respective specialisations, are: George Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew James Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States of America); and Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom). About the International Culinary Panel Since its inception in 1998, the Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel has continually redefined inflight dining. Tasked with satisfying the demands of an increasingly sophisticated traveller, the Panel has evolved over the years to reflect the diversity of excellent cuisine around the world. The Panel works closely with the Airlines own chefs, to specially create the unique selection that is available on board. Members on the Panel are Georges Blanc (France); Sanjeev Kapoor (India); Sam Leong (Singapore); Matthew James Moran (Australia); Yoshihiro Murata (Japan); Alfred Portale (United States); Gordon Ramsay (United Kingdom); and Zhu Jun (China). About Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering Since its establishment in 1999, Shanghai King Mang Jade Garden Catering Co. Pte. Ltd. has developed two key brands - Jardin de Jade and Paradise Garden  and operate a total of 15 restaurants in the Greater China region, including Shanghai, Beijing, Suzhou and Macau. Known for its outstanding research and development capability, consistently high product quality, excellent service and elegant dining ambience, the company has won several accolades home and abroad, including being named in the list of Chinas Top 100 Restaurant Brands. Jade Gardens mission is to promote modern Chinese culinary culture to both domestic and overseas customers, presenting to the world the charm and diversity of Chinese cuisine.

Can I order J BTC when flying F?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5071-/page1," Even though I've never tried it, I don't think it should be a problem for the OP to request a BTC different from a class he/she will be traveling in because the BTC the request is from the lower traveling class than the one that will be flown in. But in terms of refusing the BTC because wanting something off the in-flight menu, it won't be a problem. I have done this quite a few times where the things listed on the F menu looks more appealing than the BTC F selection I had pre-ordered and never have the crews made a fuss about it. Overall it makes sense considering you'll know which particular dish you'll be getting by BTC but highly unlikely you'll know what the onboard menu on your flight will offer until the day you board the plane.

As I just had Thai the night before and my stomach is still 'fiery', I declined the BTC I ordered for the first meal and opted for something less spicy. Crew made no fuss about it. However that said, they will try their best to please you but should there be insufficient meals, (on very very rare occasions) , other passengers will get their choices ahead of you. "

Last time I took this SQ861, as wll as other SIN-HKG or HKG-SIN, this Shi Quan Shi Mes was one of the options in F menu - consistent with what mentioned in the website. Chinese Shi Quan Shi Mei Starting in April 2005, Singapore Airlines has been providing its First Class passengers with the sumptuous Chinese meal, Shi Quan Shi Mei. The full course Chinese meal has been served on selected Chinese routes, starting with Shanghai, and expanding to other Chinese cities, including Hong Kong and Taipei. Shi Quan Shi Mei embraces the perfection of fine Chinese cuisine, with 10 courses, including a classic Chinese soup dish, four cold dishes, and four hot dishes, served with a choice of fragrant steamed rice or porridge.

[/FONT [/COLOR][/B][/SIZE] Especially the oxtail soup from Hotel Borobudur in Jakarta. Actually, there are several places with good oxtail soup in Jakarta. As for the Korean style oxtail soup, the white color broth actually comes from stewing in a slow flame the bone in the soap for hours and hours. So, there's actually no milk added. However, I do find the taste to be a bit on a bland side. I guess it is intentionally bland so we can still taste the Kimchi which usually accompanied the dish. "

That was the exception, usually when I order BTC I stick to it - hate wasting food. Happened to me on SIN-JFK and SIN-FRA sectors (can't remember which direction though) Definitely service lapses IMO as on one occassion they both forgot to reconfirm my BTC (as is the norm) and rather clearly forgot my main as I was served very late. I kinda wanted to see how long it would take them to realise their error. Now that I am reminded of this incident I wish I had remembered to send in feedback about this after the flight. This was one of those times where I would have liked to pick something off the menu instead of taking my BTC. Having said that most of my flights are +10 hours long. I wonder if they are more generous in ensuring that they have some excess on these long flights versus the shorter regional ones. Since this happened on my ultra/long hauls that's why I""m asking for my JFK-SIN as with the long flight and having had to put up with not great catering on my 3wk business trip so far, being trapped on the plane with more bad food or subpar service is just going to make the flight even longer than it is! #Firstworldproblems, I know. The upside is the meeting agenda before my flight has changed so I will have far more time in the VS lounge than expected so I can at least have a decent meal before I board the whalejet. The other downer being I really do not like flying the A380 so being able to have a halfway decent experience would help. And that includes my meal selections! "

I've tried this BTC selection before (a couple of years back), and while my previous meal was good, this time round it was even better than I remember it. An excellent dish. "

BTC - Pictures collection,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/920-/page12, I should share some pictures of my past BTCs here! Will dig it up soon from storage and post it here. They're all in JCL. Was wondering though.. Is it a good idea to BTC in F? So far I used BTC in J. I'm not very familiar with what it is like in F but I guess that it'd be similar to the BTC options in J. So on that note it's probably better to rely on the menu of the day since that's a dedicated meal crafted for F. Does this make any sense? or are F menus nothing that special usually in which case BTC would be a better idea? 
BTC - Pictures collection,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/920-/page12," In F, just BTC. If you like something onboard they should bend over backwards to get you what you want. It's the one differentiator soft-ware wise between J and F with SQ that I would note... "

SQ 24 is the world’s longest scheduled commercial flight and the flying time is eighteen hours, and yet the menu is just insufficient in terms of quantity and quality. Three FULL meals should be served, instead of two. They served lunch after takeoff, and they did not serve dinner till 9pm Singapore local time. From my previous experience with SQ’s ultra-long-haul flight, I ordered a sandwich around 6pm local time. Honestly the sandwich was nice, but small. Dinner was just bad overall. The appetizer was ridiculous and basically leftover chicken and diced fruit threw together and put on top of some lettuce. The dressing was missing and I was not sure if the crews forgot and they never loaded it. I ordered BTC for main meal and the beef was only so-so. Then the desserts were served and I chose both the cheese plate and the passionfruit pound cake, which was awful. The mousse was artificial tasting and honestly any US supermarkets can serve better cakes than SQ. With more than eight hours left, it concluded all the main meal services. I ordered the soy sauce chicken noodles prior to arrival and it was basically instant noodles tossed in soy sauce with some chicken. At least I got some real protein, but that’s it. The snack menu was just poor with lack of “real fresh food” offered. A hot light meal should be offered prior to arrival. As an aviation enthusiast, I flew this flight but I have ZERO interest to fly these long-haul flights again on Singapore Airlines. I wrote a pretty strongly worded email to Singapore Airlines and got a polite reply. However I voted with my wallet. I will not fly any SQ long haul flights beyond twelve hours. If you have to fly SQ ultra-long-haul flights even in business class, please remember to pack some snacks and remember that you can order as much instant noodles as you want. Don’t be shy because you might be hungry even after that annoying midflight dinner service. "

Then the SQ girl came to me and said that they had 'misplaced it'. I said 'you havent misplaced it, that guy over there is eating it'. Apparantly they got it confused with a lamb chop!!! Anyway it was all very lighthearted, resolved very amicably and really was not much of an issue .... just a little dissappointing. As usual, the girl apologised countless times and we had a good joke about it. Ended up with the lamb (washed down with a few bottles of Krug) which was lovely. So to those who have done BTC ... make sure you get what you have ordered!! "

Cabin crew and not just SQ really should have diligence and common sense when giving out special meals. They have to learn that its not a 'fad' and some people are very allergic to some items. I am allergic to wheat flour but not as allergic as someone who is celiac. If I am to get a special meal (and I have to request gluten free cos SQ doesn't make just wheat-free meals when I travel in economy), cabin crew still put a bread bun on my tray even though the tray states the special meal. Its almost as bad as when my friend who is allergic to nuts travels on SQ. She is not too allergic to nuts but still cabin crew should be versed about the seriousness of allergies rather than look at it as a 'fad'. She travelled from MAN to SIN, and cabin crew still gave her a bag of peanuts! "

Designed by Singapore Airlines International Culinary Panel Chef Suzanne Goin One of the better BTCs so far. Had a low expectation as fish and meat dishes tend to dry out on board. But this fish was moist, and the skin was super crispy which provided a very nice contrast. The overall flavour was simple, and fresh. Really good. Will order again. "

Decided to go for the fish on broth instead and the lamb shank. Then the wife decided not to have the BTC and try the tandoori lamb on 227, so didn't get a photo of that.

Honeymoon cake in flight ?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7121-/page1, The day after our wedding we will be travelling from Brussels via Frankfurt and Singapore to Bali.

Do they need a legal certificate of the wedding ? Kind regards

What are the Standard Meals on Singapore Airlines like in Economy,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/6957-/page1, Was wondering out of Australia where Qantas does the catering what the standard inflight meals for Singapore Airlines are like.

My wife had it when we flew Suites and she regretted it! Thankfully she could order the other stuff available on the menu. Go with the BTC waffles it's good or if you're departing from SG then the french toast from the menu is good too as we had kaya mascarpone with it which is only available ex-SG.

Perfect for a 12.55am departure. The pork ribs were tender, and the broth had good flavour and was piping hot (Thankfully no clear air turbulence on this flight...). I was also very impressed that the Bak Kut Teh came with several traditional accompaniments. Note that this is Singapore style Bak Kut Teh, with clear, slightly peppery broth, and not the dark, rich broth you get in Malaysian Klang-style Bak Kut Teh. Very good attention to detail, including the peanuts, salted vegetables, sliced red chilli and dark soy sauce. Maybe next time I will pack my own chopped fresh garlic "

I had thought the service gonna be supper/breakfast, as from what I read so far in this forum. As someone who never flown J on such a long flight, and as someone who will not easily fall asleep on the plane, I do wished to be served 2 meals. I had wanted to order 2 BTC meals, Roasted Vegetable Salad and the Swedish Multigrain Bread if given a choice. Wondering if I consumed the BTC meal immediately after take off, will I still be able to get something to be served for b'fast? Not sure if it gonna be easy as I am a vegetarian as well. Anyway, I am still not sure if the BTC had been updated , as I still see Slipper Lobster Thermidor as a choice.

Special Meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10988-/page1," Hi, I'm going to Dhaka, Bangladesh at the end of this year from Auckland, New Zealand on Singapore airlines. I have to order the Muslim Meal, however I found them really disappointing compared to what others would get in flight. The meals were good but other passengers would get extras such as crossaints, chocolate, ice-cream or really good looking desserts. However, I would be stuck with a bread roll and fruit salad. The thing I don't understand is how chocolate and ice-cream can't be suitable for a muslim meal. So, this time I would like to get a different meal such as Vegetarian Indian Meal or Vegetarian Lacto-Ovo Meal but, how likely would it be if there was alcohol in the meal? and how spicy would the Vegetarian Indian Meal be? "
Special Meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10988-/page1," Welcome to SQ Talk ! Special religious meals are prepared with strict relligious guidelines... hence the meals are prepared according to a 'set' style. Some muslims may refrain from 'normal' baked goods because they are not halal. Strict muslims require that everything served to them must be halal - right up to the person serving them. But since SQ has no specific guidelines, they do their best - as with any airline unless you fly with a muslim carrier like Malaysia Airlines - then all food served is Halal. If you cannot take alcohol due to religious reasons, then I'd stay with the muslim meal. I would not think there would be any alcohol in the other vegetarian foods... besides alcohol evaporates when cooked anyway! If you feel like you want the ice cream, chocolate, and other breads, then just ask for it. No need to look hungrily over your neighbours shoulder ! "

Special Meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10988-/page1," Have a question regarding Special Meal, I did not want to start a new thread, so posting my question here. I see the following meals available for infants, anyone has more info about them? Baby Meal (BBML) Suitable for infants less than 1 year old, this meal consists of 3 jars of assorted baby food - main course, vegetables and dessert. Post-Weaning Meal (PWMLM) Suitable for infants between 1 and 2 years old, this meal is more substantial than a Baby Meal. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest. Child Meal for Infant (CHMLI) Suitable for infants less than 2 years old, this meal is more substantial in terms of quantity and choice of meal components. Food items are easy to bite, chew and digest. 1) Would a meal be provided for him for SIN - TPE (and back). Would be travelling in business. 2) Since my son will be < 1 years old, only the first and third description fit his age. Any idea what is the difference. Of course I will ask SQ when I get down to booking his ticket and will probably choose the meal according to their description and what my son eats closer to the departure date. From what I deduce, BBML is the smallest portion, suitable for infants < 1 year old, while the other two should be for 1 to 2 years old, with CHMLI having larger portion than PWMLM. "
Special Meals,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10988-/page1," Yes, you son will get a meal. For BBML, it is just that you get 3 bottles of Heinz baby food. CC will warm it up if you like. Don't know about the other 2. "

Merged with all the earlier requests from the OP for the same thing........ 
SQ345 / SQ346,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11080-/page1, Anybody know what's on the menu (economy class)? 
No BTC in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5125-/page1," On my forthcoming flight over 4-5h in regional F into Singapore, there's no BTC option but you can order food like seafood or oriental. Normally, I would not do meal order when there's no BTC offering. I am thinking of placing an order for oriental food. Am I risking it? I found out I am the only passenger in F which means catering onboard would be very limited. I believe the normal dinner menu will be rather less elaborate? Any suggestion? "

I found out I am the only passenger in F which means catering onboard would be very limited. I believe the normal dinner menu will be rather less elaborate? Any suggestion? Your title is misleading I must say. Not all station has BTC options. Singapore and 13 other stations: Amsterdam Dubai Frankfurt Hong Kong London Los Angeles Melbourne New York (JFK and EWR) San Francisco Singapore Sydney Taipei Tokyo Thus, you are not departing from any of the stations above. Therefore there is no BTC. And as far as I know, the seafood or oriental food is a special meal order, something similar to the options for pax who wants kosher meals, or vegetarian, or ... If you know you are the only F pax on board, why would you think the catering on board will be limited? It is a pax' dream to have the whole cabin for himself/herself. I think we even have a thread for ""solo in front cabin."" The catering will still load all the meals. So you can have all the choices as shown on the menu. And dinner service will not be less elaborate. It's still the standard service like in a full flight. If I were you, I would not order seafood or oriental special meals. I would not know what I would have, and I would not know how the seafood would be cooked. From the non-BTC station. I will chance it on the menu onboard. At least I know that on board SQ, there will be at least one Asian main course. "

I know I'll be in the minority for this but in reality I actually prefer having other ""strangers"" (pax whom I do not know) in the cabin when I am ""traveling by myself"" in F. I know having more passengers in the F/R cabin will mean that the crews will have less time to deal with you compared if you are the sole one. But I still prefer having people around myself simply because if I were to be in the cabin all by myself all alone flying in the middle of nowhere on a long haul (especially in an overnight flight when the cabin crews are resting), it does give me some chills upon my shoulder. I know there are other pax in the J & Y cabins but I can't really see them while I'm in the F/R cabin. Just a personal taste. "

I don't think I had ever run across cabin crew on SQ who dissuaded premium pax from asking for something that was on offer.

Likewise here. I was the only person drinking the DP in F earlier this year (the other 2 pax declined all food and drink, preferring instead to snooze the flight away -- you can tell who the real frequent Flyers are ), and the FAs were all more than generous with the fizz. To illustrate: After I woke up from my little nap in the final stages of the flight, the LSS suddenly appeared to offer more champagne. Immediately after serving it to me, she'd noticed that the champagne was no longer bubbly and actually removed it and came back with a new glass from a freshly opened bottle. All unprompted and proactiveness on her part! Of course, I couldn't stand the thought of all that DP going to waste and did my best to demolish the bottle before preparations for landing had commenced. "

The times I've flown in F alone, they still loaded ALL the regular choices, despite knowing full well what I had chosen beforehand (i.e. the BTC) - that is utterly amazing. I can't really say it was because they were catering for possible opups into F since on both those flights, Y and J were nowhere near full. This last trip last month SIN-ICN - the IFS said it so matter of factly as if it happens all the time, and from my experience, I cannot dispute it "

I thought that was what you meant in your original notes, but I had to ask because it is hard to believe! By the way, you seem to be ome of the most active people on the site, so can you give me any tips to rally other SQ Talkers to meet up when I'm in Singapore (airport or the city) ? I did make a post in the community forum but the ""lounge meets"" seems to be a sprawling forum so it's tough to get noticed! Or is it? Anway, meandering off topic a bit there, tut tut! "

Bear in mind selections are generally very limited after the first meal session (from rather recent experiences over the last 10-odd months, but at least I've encountered them uploading the main menu and not just the BTC order with no other choices like two other prominent SQTalk VVIPs had sometime back).

I am pesce/pollotarian (fish and chicken only eater). If it helps you, you might try ordering seafood-only meal. In sq, the moment when i am served instant noodles can be counted by finger (normally because the selection run out or simply the selection is a no-no), and if you don't book special meal it is advisable to sit in front section of the plane where you are served first.

Question regarding 2nd growth- Bordeaux in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3845-/page1," On all of my recent F and Suites flights, I noticed that there is only 1 2nd Growth- Bordeaux left in the wine list (Château Léoville-Poyferré). If I remember it correctly, SQ served 2 2nd Growth- Bordeaux (Château Léoville-Poyferré and Château Cos d'Estournel) last year. Did Cos d'Estournel also fall victim to SQ's cost-cutting? I'm aware that most Airlines don't serve 2nd Growth- Bordeaux anymore these days and I'm not a huge fan anyway but I was wondering if this is permanent measure... "
Question regarding 2nd growth- Bordeaux in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3845-/page1," Looking back into the menus and wine lists I've saved (and some I've seen here on SQT), I believe SQ typically serves only one Bordeaux on a given flight, and it is often contrasted with a New World wine from the origin/destination country. For example, SQ would have the Cos or the Poyferre matched with Sequoia Grove Napa cab on California flights or a shiraz from Torbeck or Killikanoon on Australia flights. I think I've only seen one wine list from SQ sporting two Bordeaux (Cos and Pichon-Lalande, IIRC), and for some reason I think it was on a Japan flight (where Bordeaux are hugely popular). Perhaps others can provide more examples. As for whether SQ has permanently switch from Cos to Poyferre as the standard offering, I don't know but it would seem so. I haven't seen any SQ F wine lists on here with Cos in a while-- save for the A380 inaugural to SYD, which sported a 1982 Cos and another '82 Bordeaux, equally delicious. On my last SQ 001/002, they served Poyferre and it was very good. But I prefer Cos. "
Question regarding 2nd growth- Bordeaux in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3845-/page1, Hmm....interesting. http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...ite/dining.jsp On this page they show a picture of Cos and mention 2nd growth bordeaux. The picture also is lower quality compared to the rest of the pics on the page which makes it look like they pulled it straight from google image

I'm aware that most Airlines don't serve 2nd Growth- Bordeaux anymore these days and I'm not a huge fan anyway but I was wondering if this is permanent measure... I believe you're right in that they have switched from two to one Bordeaux. This time last year, it was Cos 1999 plus Pichon Lalande 1998 on my routes. Interestingly in F SIN-AKL last month it was Leoville-Poyferre, but AKL-SIN was Cos. All R routes were Cos last month. Dropping a Bordeaux wouldn't be such a big deal if it was offset by wider choice, for example both a pinot noir and a syrah, as well as the Boardeaux, but that doesn't happen. Plus of course the quality is pinched, with a Pichon Lalande 98 at ~US$90 bottle and Cos 99 at ~US$65. So, yes, it's clear that the bean counters are at work. Offset fuel costs by dropping wine. On the wine front, there are sometimes some interesting choices. For example on SIN-HKG there were two sweet Rieslings in the whites as the only choice. They were both great should you choose the Chinese tasting menu, but otherwise as a food match you'd be struggling. Howard "

The seat froze two or three times, but luckily we had a fabulous LSS who was a bit long in the tooth on the SkySuites. She asked me to move (or climb out!), reached underneat the left hand side of the seat, gave it a hell of a yank and problem solved. The comment was made that they have not bothered looking after the old girls due to them leaving in the not too distant, which is a disgrace from both a pax point of view (I didn't mind having to keep climbing out of the flat seat that refused to go back up, but I'm sure others would) and also after they have served them so well for so long.

I have only succeeded once for a flight in Sept 2012. My apologies for the late reply. I recently did try asking for a vegetarian starter but failed. Only had 1 success. Would be great if someone can upload the pic for Lemon and Mint Artichoke Ravioli. "

It wasn't as bad as it looked! Some sort of lentil-ish thingy with a rice-stuffed potato. The appetiser was made mostly of grapefruit pulp (I think) and some vegetables. I appreciate that they tried to be creative. I was expecting something mundane like only boiled vegetables lol Only dislike is they served the bread with margarine. I wouldn't never eat that horrible near-plastic substance! but not a big issue, I asked for olive oil instead [IMG][/IMG] "

Both looked terrible in terms of presentation. One was covered in brown/red sauce of some sort (and I believe eggplant), and other was arranged into three 'farmer'-style rows in pale-yellow brown. I was very happy with the pre-booked seafood meal. Of course, they served it way in advance too. Thumbs up - and the IFS was serving in Y on this flight with a very pleasant Japanese stewardess, probably the best in SQ Y I've had for a (very) long time. "

The Poyferre was actually quite decent, after I let it oxygenate sufficienty (aided by some turbulence off the California coast), but I think the Cos would have been better.

The mixed baby lettuces were baby elephant lettuces (huge!), which made it a little unruly to eat but I liked the sweet-and-salty sesame-soya dressing. I had the lamb chops BTC; the lamb was very good, not overcooked or dry but juicy, flavorful meat; served as chops it looks huge at first but is actually a manageable portion; went nicely with the Bordeaux. The strudel was excellent: very light pastry dough puffed up almost like a souffle with the red bean paste inside; the green tea ice cream almost tasted like green-tea-and-vanilla, but it was delicious. I had a modest serving of cheese and skipped the fruit. HKG-SFO I was so stuffed from the first segment that I skipped the appies, neither of which really spoke to me. The soup was good, but more brothy than creamy; don't expect corn chowder. Caesar salad was tasty, though the romaine wedges were large and required cutting. I had the BTC veal, which came as a positively massive portion, of which I finished barely half. If I skipped dessert (can't remember), I shouldn't have, because it really sounds tasty now, looking back. Definitely skipped cheese and fruit. Flight was pretty short, at 10:30 flight time (vs. over 14:30 on SFO-HKG a few weeks earlier). I slept about 6.5 hours but didn't feel like breakfast when it was time. I just had juice, lots of coffee, and the granola with yoghurt and fruit compote, which remains one of the tastier breakfast items SQ serves in F. "

I'm travelling with kids, and the ""lunch serving time"" is their nap time. Moreover, we would already have had lunch at the SKL. Plus, we're arriving late, and given an additional hour or so to get into Osaka itself, so dinner makes sense. Hopefully they oblige given the circumstances of the flight time.

The important thing to note is this -- Ask, before the flight actually takes off, ie. when you've just boarded. This is because the crew tends to heat up all the meals during take-off and when a meal is already heated up, its too late to keep for you. Especially in your case where you've very good reasons, I see no reason why they'll not oblige. "

Then afterwards, casually I said to the young FS that I prefer bee hoon. I told him since I was served kway teow, it means that no bee hoon was loaded. Then we talked about instant noodles etc. He came back to the kitchen and showed me how the packaging of the noodles and all of them were kway teow. Of course the CS saw we were chatting and he remembered that I ordered bee hoon. The CS came back ten minutes later or so with bee hoon which he found in First galley. "

Suites to CDG,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13911-/page1," Hi all, sorry if this question has already been asked. For a flight out of SIN to Paris (midnight-ish) in Suites, can the dinner be served really at any time, i.e not a slight delay, but, say, after a night of sleep... Take off 12am, that would mean having dinner 7-8 hours in the flight, when most pax are asleeped (and closer to the usual too-early breakfast) ? Safer also to order at the same time than other pax, I suppose ? We are looking at a light dinner at the TPR first (at ""normal"" dinner time), but then the timing is not great for a full dinner at 1am after take off... (unless we see it in the perspective of taking dinner at Paris-time Thanks ! "

No mushrooms (SQ LPP would approve! ), sauce was quite light, huge (~4cm diameter) chunks of fresh lobster.

It's basically a brown-greyish something and doesn't look very good in the air. Little bit of salad on the side: not a filling dish either. I was very underwhelmed to say the least... "

Please note the following: -these photos were taken on SQ800 circa 5:20AM -SQ800 is a sleeper flight (which means a choice of supper or breakfast) with a 1AM departure -in F, a special meal request such as the KSML (Kosher) or SFML (Seafood) seems to mean (happy to be corrected if wrong) two uploads of food -one upload will be for after take-off (i.e. dinner/supper) or before arrival (i.e. breakfast) -for this particular flight, a dinner KSML package was loaded, as well as a breakfast one It took quite awhile to compile the results of this scientific experiment (read: procrastination) - without further ado, I present an F Kosher Meal (Breakfast edition): Packaging - wrapped up, you can opt to break the seal yourself or let the cabin crew do it for you (it's a little messy/filled with condensation so I let the cabin crew do it) The Spread - nearly overflows 9V-SQC's F table... The Main Event - (HEAVILY) smoked haddock, with roast potatoes and roast vegetables (courgettes, aubergines and onions) The Muffin (whose name I can't pronounced) - Which quickly became my main course as I didn't find the rest that appetising (everything else was just way, way too salty + smoky) The appetiser - More smoked fish, slightly more edible than the main fish dish, but still very chewy The cabin smelt like smoked fish after that... at least 1AB! Won't be doing this one again and I soon gave up and ordered off the main menu (thankfully far more palatable). Final words: Don't order except for religious reasons (obviously) "

(Am considering NGO as part of my RTW). Care to recommend me a place for some delicious Unagi? Perhaps an Unagi Do one day. Heh ehe Absolutely! Try Hourai-ken Matsuzakaya-ken. 3-16-1 Sakae. In the south building of Matsuzakaya department store, in the back on the 10th floor (look for the sign that says UNAGI HORAIKEN). Yabacho Station is your subway stop. This eel restaurant is a branch of two famous restaurants near Atsuta Shrine. There is an English-language menu that maps out how to eat the Hitsumabushi thats rather funny. However, you can't go wrong ordering one of the various unagi donburi (rice casserole with eel on top). Most famous is the Hitsumabushi, a set meal for ¥2,300 that includes unagi donburi, various condiments, miso soup, and Japanese pickles. Eating it is a ritual (as described in the English menu): First, dish out some of the eel casserole into the smaller wooden bowl and eat it plain. For the next course, try it with some of the seaweed and green onions that come with it. Finally, add some of the soup and wasabi to the last mixture you tried. But be sure to not miss out on the chicken wings at any of the Yama-chan locations. Get off the plane and head to one. Get an order (or four or five) and a beer. You'll be all good! Also, be sure to arrive at NGO early as it is probably one of my favorite airports. Beautiful design with tons of shops and restaurants in the middle (I never even make it to the lounges). Look for shops with JL FAs and you're sure to be picking up some really nice gifts. "

From my personal point of view, that doesn't sounds appealing to my brain. Ex-Japan food are pretty costly. So, I would rather have something Japanese. Looking at the list below: Menu Chicken stuffed with prosciutto and mushrooms in creamy sauce with braised turnip, spinach, and potatoes Grilled fillet of beef with pesto and tomato couscous Seafood bouillabaisse with spaghetti Braised seafood in hot bean sauce with mixed vegetables and fried noodles Chicken and eggplant Shigi-yaki and steamed rice with green peas Chirashi Sushi Fried sea bass with hot garlic sauce and mixed vegetables and bee hoon Grilled tuna with vinegared white miso and mixed seaweed sauce served with udon Japanese beef curry with rice Shouyu Ramen (Soya flavoured noodle soup with char siew and vegetables) Stir-fried beef with black bean sauce with assorted Chinese vegetables and fried rice Unagi Kabayaki I would rather pick beef curry. And I would compare to what's available on the menu especially the Hanagoyomi set (similar idea like kyo-kaiseki). I remembered I was in the same flight as Kiwi, and we both enjoyed hangoyomi. Also last year, I sent my hanagoyomi to KeithMel and his parents who happened to be in the same flight but they were in Y. I recalled they said it was good. "

But I noticed that they do offer a BTC option with the full array of choices of dinner like Lobster, Lamb, Kaiseki, etc... and I was wondering if anyone has done a BTC at this hour.

BTC planning,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3135-/page3," Originally posted by dttj0069 View Post Hi, I'm flying F on SQ231 to SYD departing at 0030hrs. This timing is quite similar to some Europe-bound flights too. Anyway, most of the time when people board these late night flights, they go straight to sleep and skip the supper. But I noticed that they do offer a BTC option with the full array of choices of dinner like Lobster, Lamb, Kaiseki, etc... and I was wondering if anyone has done a BTC at this hour. I've never tried the Kyo-Kaiseki which is only offered on F i think (and I hardly fly F). But it does seem a little greedy to be the only one on the plane eating the whole spread, right? Anyone to share experience. I did that red eye flight to SYD or to NRT. To make it easier, don't think about other pax. Remember that there are so many possibilities that might affect other pax. For example, a pax who wants to sleep on that flight, maybe he/she really wants to rest, or maybe he/she had dinner prior to the flight (in SIN or in connecting flight), or other reasons. You are in F. Just think what you really want. If you can handle a big meal (yes this flight now gives you only one meal service, i.e after taking off or before landing), go for it. I had rack of lamb many times on those late night flight and even had dessert as well... But I am not too fond of kyo-kaiseki on SQ. "

Hope you have better experience next time. The customer service bar is so low with most US airlines (exception is Alaska Air, btw, which happens to be partners with CX) that three calls and 15 minutes to take care of simple task didn't even faze me. The nightmare scenario is the ""we can't help you"" preceded by something like this: 1. Busy signal on first five calls. 2. Ring on next call. Byzantine voicemail options tree not helped by the ""please listen carefully, our voicemail options have changed"" preamble. Yes, they changed all right--during the Clinton administration. 3. Eventually press the right combination of keys after 3 or 4 more calls only to hear the ""all reps are currently busy. Thank you for your patience"" refrain. I'm not particularly patient, but what the hell else am I going to do? 4. This is followed by several renditions of the ""your call is very important to us"" and ""all reps are still busy"" tape loop. If I hadn't heard the first part a few thousand times from every corporate boiler room from the phone company to the garbage hauler--none of whom really give a rat's ass about MY call--it might even leave me feeling all warm and fuzzy. As it is, I roll my eyes wearily and hang on for the long haul. (Think of it as packed full nonstop C class from EWR-SIN in a middle seat between a really fat guy and somebody in F's nanny holding a constantly screaming infant.) 5. Every so often, as if intended to break up the monotony, a different recorded voice advises that ""due to unusually high call volume"" it may take a while for someone to actually answer the phone. When you've heard this with the same airline over a period of months, with nothing special going on on the calendar, you know it's pure bullshit intended to outwit the gullible. My brain screams, ""Hey, how about hiring a few more minimum wage slaves with no training so you can at least handle your average call volume, assholes?"" But I digress. 6. Bad music (often an airline theme or some calming version of a pathetic pop standard) seemingly recorded in 1975 given all the skips, pops and static, plays between the taped excuses. 7. Forty-five minutes after the first call, real-life person picks up only to advise solemnly that I've foolishly called the wrong 800 number, and ""No, sorry sir, I'm unable to transfer you. . ."" Homicidal thoughts well up until the medication takes hold much later. ""Thank you for flying Sky High Airlines. We appreciate your business."" --mcz "

Vegetarian BTC options in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5444-/page1," Greetings, I've got an upcoming SIN-FRA in F at the end of December. While I'm certainly looking forward to the SkySuite, my concern is about the BTC options available, being vegetarian (seafood doesn't work either). Two questions hence: 1. Has anyone tried the only vegetarian option I could find in the BTC menu (""Roasted vegetables"") and is it worth the trouble? Details welcome. 2. What would the experts here recommend I ask for if I was to expect getting something other than a Y meal presented on F cutlery? Thoughts appreciated. Cheers! "
Vegetarian BTC options in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5444-/page1," Originally posted by LightSpeed View Post 1. Has anyone tried the only vegetarian option I could find in the BTC menu (""Roasted vegetables"") and is it worth the trouble? Details welcome. I've had this dish several times, and it's one of my favorite. It's delicious and, though it's vegetarian, it is very filling and definitely not light.

But just in case, occasionally, in the main menu there is an choice of meatless option, but not always there in the menu. Sometimes the soup is interesting as well, like cream of asparagus.

If you want to order a BTC for the main dish AND a special meal (e.g. VLML) for the other courses, you have to ask the agent to input the special meal code plus the BTC code.

"""Criteria"" for satay service?",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10775-/page1," Satay is prepared ex-Sin, & usually it will be included only on lunch and dinner Full-Service meals on flight times longer than 4 hours only. It usually will not be offered on brunch & supper services too. And it will not be offered on all flights to/from Australia and New Zealand. But I cannot answer as to why SQ 37 has no satay though it is dinner service. "
"""Criteria"" for satay service?",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/10775-/page1," Several years ago, SIA used to offer Satay ex-LAX. So SQ11 starts with Satay service. When SQ37 direct LAX-SIN flight was first introduced, SIA wanted to offer something even more special, so instead of Satay, they have other form of finger food. For eg, they once served Vietnamese spring roll + something else (can't recall). That was also the time when they had Executive Economy on SQ37 and initially even offered Champagne on EE class. However, in recent years, because of cost reduction, they have completely stopped Satay service ex-LAX. I've not flown on SQ37 for some time so I'm not sure if they're still offering the pre-dinner finger food. There's no more Executive Economy on SQ37. Whether Satay is offered is not dependent on whether the flight is ex-Sin or Dinner service. For eg, you get Satay (instead of peanuts as the finger food) ex-JFK, ex-NRT, ex-Seoul and several European cities. "

I know I've had satay on SQ 319 cuz I remember the Panjabi LSS who served it the last time I was on that flight. The satay service I believe constitutes what would otherwise have been canapes that come with pre-dinner drinks. I wonder if SQ 38's relatively later departure makes them think people would rather go straight into a full dinner course than have satay and a cocktail which might push dinner into the midnight PST mark. At least the last time I was on SQ 319, we took off on a sunny summery early evening and there was plenty of time for satay and cocktails before a late dinner on European time "

My comments: Ex-SFO I had orderd the veal chop, I think. After seeing the Nancy Oakes lamb dish, I opted for that instead, which was no problem. Had Dom before takeoff, then a Sling with nuts and asked the Stewardess to pour a glass of Bordeaux so it could breathe. I had the Sonoma Cutrer Chard with the baked scallop (tasty) and the pea soup (really great). The lamb did not disappoint, and it paired well with the Leoville-Poyferre. The Stewardess, who was really excellent and very friendly and spontaneous, offered dessert or cheese, to which I responded, ""Yes, please."" The tiramisu was quite good and so were the cheeses. I passed on the fruit, which is always on all airlines served way too cold. Then I slept, woke up to watch a movie, slept, and woke up way too early. Couldn't get back to sleep, so I had breakfast. The French toast was kind of mushy, so I picked at it. I tried to sleep again after takeoff from HKG, and had breakfast again halfway into that flight. The eggs were light and fluffy, as always. Another excellent SQ 001 in Seat 2A. "

The tomato soup was quite good too. I had the BTC lamb chops with mint jelly; the lamb was tasty enough but the portion was a bit on the smallish side. I think I skipped dessert and went for the cheeses. Then they told me they had run out of Bordeaux (everyone was drinking it!), so I went with the Seqouia Grove cab (a decent cab but certainly not the best of Napa and not really Bordeaux-style). The bread basket was particularly good on this flight, with a large flat bread encrusted with parmesan cheese. After takeoff from Hong Kong, I really didn't want to eat dinner again, so I asked them to just serve the soup and hold onto everything else so I could have it closer to San Francisco. The mushroom soup was disappointing, not much flavor. So I knocked back a few more glasses of Bordeaux--the turbulence off Kyushu forced me to drink fast, lest I spill--and went to sleep for nearly 8 hours. Waking up from that, a big veal chop wasn't really appetizing. So I had the breakfast menu-- yoghurt good enough though tart, and I think I had the eggs. "

Check out the BTC menu and see if there is anything you fancy. If breakfast is going to be served on your flight, then I won't BTC, as I don't fancy the breakfast options. If you have BTC-ed and want something else from the regular menu just tell the staff when they come round to take your order.

I hope you enjoy your stay here. Once you step into our airport, be fascinated as this airport has won numerous awards these past few years. SQ285/286 is a popular sector due to the timing thus the aircraft used is the B777-300ER. Are you in business class? If you are, you will be enjoying a fully flat bed. There will be direct access to the aisle for every seat as the configuration is 1-2-1. Also, the entertainment of movies & music will be much more than the B777-200ER. These seats & entertainment similarly are found on our existing A380, A345 as well as A330 which proved popular with SQ customers. As for SQ282, yes, the beds are SpaceBed in Business class, similar to those found on the 747 jumbo. The seat configuration of this aircraft will be 2-2-2. Hi Chesty, My turn to reply your message. Are you in business or economy firstly? If you are in business, it is a sleeper service, meaning to enable passengers to sleep longer & have undisturbed rest, only 1 meal will be served. Thus a full meal supper is served. If you are in economy, no sleeper service, thus 2 meals will be served, Supper + Breakfast (Menu will indicate ""Before Touch Down"" Menu). If you prefer other flights serving 2 meals, it will be SQ238 and SQ228. Just fyi from 29 Sep onwards, the A380 will be operating on SQ228 on a daily basis. Thanks Feb01mel. I am in J class so just the one meal. I could have gone one of the other flights but really wanted to try the new business class product as its my first time in J with SQ. Also travelling next month so miss out on the A380 but do get the 747 on the way back. At least with the Supper I will get to enjoy the full dining experience by the sounds of it. "

Lunch/Dinner main menu definitely is better than supper if you ask me. SQ281/282 has spacebeds, not regional config & seating. "

Nasi Lemak on SQ800 SIN-PEK (J) Red-Eye,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13290-/page1," I recently flew SQ800 SIN-PEK in J. This was a 12.55am departure and arrival at 7.05am, with a flight time around, or just under, 6 hours. In terms of catering, SQ calls this their ""Sleeper Service"" menu: A fairly streamlined (i.e. cut-down) menu with just a single main course -- no starter or dessert to speak of, which you can have either as supper after take-off or for breakfast before landing. They say this is to maximize the amount of sleep you get on this flight (Although the skeptic in me says this is also a great way to cut costs...). The last time I flew this route many months ago, I had a wonderful Bak Kut Teh supper. This time, I was a little surprised to find that, while the menu was positioned as supper after take-off, or breakfast before landing, most of the dishes were breakfast dishes, and that none of the choices available would have counted as a proper supper. Am I the only one who wishes for a more elaborate supper offering on this flight? This was the menu on offer: When I booked the flight, I had planned to have supper onboard. I had no interest in being woken up 2+ hours before landing, at around 5am, for breakfast... To be frank, none of the choices really interested me. Most were breakfast dishes. I made a mental note to do a BTC (Book The Cook) the next time I flew this route. The most interesting supper item on the menu was nasi lemak, a local Asian dish, comprising coconut-flavoured rice, chilli and various dishes such as egg, chicken, fish (ikan bilis...small deep-fried fish) and sambal chilli which is popular for breakfast in Singapore and Malaysia, and would work fine for a meal at other times as well. Nasi lemak is a dish which you get at hawker centres and food courts in Singapore for S$3 or less...how would SQ's business class version compare? "
Nasi Lemak on SQ800 SIN-PEK (J) Red-Eye,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13290-/page1," My nasi lemak was served right after take-off... This looked like a ""deluxe"" version of nasi lemak, with more substantial meat and seafood dishes than the run-of-the-mill versions served in hawker centres, and comparable to some of the more up-market nasi lemak stalls you get in Singapore (Like the one at Changi Village Food Centre, for example, with it's long queues...). Apart from a large helping of coconut rice, you had a large piece of chicken, succulent shrimp, slices of egg omelette, a small piece of otak, and a large helping of the all-important sambal chilli sauce. A large bowl of crisp ikan bilis (deep fried fish) was provided separately. "
Nasi Lemak on SQ800 SIN-PEK (J) Red-Eye,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/13290-/page1," Verdict? This was actually quite delicious. Setting aside the minor quibbles I had about the shortened meal service format and lack of other supper options, I have to acknowledge that taken on its own terms, the nasi lemak was excellent. The coconut rice was warm, and had beautiful flavour and texture. The sambal chilli had quite a kick, and the ikan bilis was still crisp. The chicken was still juicy and not too dry. I also liked the fact that the plate was lined with a banana leaf -- a very authentic touch. Overall, this was very satisfying -- an intensely flavourful dish that worked well, and would easily withstand comparison with nasi lemak served on the ground in coffee shops and hawker centres. "

BTC SIN-LHR comparisons,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11949-/page1," The dimsum should be allowed as an addition as it's nowhere near close enough to a full meal for me. And it seems, for Dent@SUB also. The lamb (any) is always good in my experience. But for those watching their weight, the seabass is always popular. I've had it far too many times as a breakfast to count on the red-eyes where it's a supper option too. "
BTC SIN-LHR comparisons,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/11949-/page1," I agree with Kyo, Chilean sea bass always good option, esp when trying not to overindulge. Have had various versions many times. The reason it is a good option is that Chilean sea bass is not easy to overcook. You can cook it and cook it and unless you really really really overdue it, you will be able to get a delicious moist fish like it was cooked by an expert chef. That's ideal for airline galley service. "

However, not enough rice to enjoy the meal to the fullest Agree that this was a great dish and I was very pleasantly surprised. I too found that there wasn't enough rice for the meal.

Vegetarian Options in Y,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5692-/page1," Hi. I'm getting quite excited now, just 9 weeks to go to our next flight on SQ! I'm vegetarian, so I'm used to the usual Lacto Ovo offerings on SQ. When I was booking online I noticed all the other vege options and I'm interested to try them (particularly I'm interested in the Oriental and Indian - Non strict options). Can anyone who has tried the various vege options on SQ let me know their thoughts? There is nothing wrong with the lacto-ovo option, I just thought it would be nice to try something new. I'm travelling LHR-SIN-BNE. Thank you. "

You know, I never really take pictures on flights, and considering I have a background in photography I think that's pretty bad. Since I've discovered this forum and realised how many people take pictures of EVERYTHING on board, I now know the SQ guys and girls won't think I'm crazy if I photograph my food. So I would be delighted to take photographs of the food, and I will definitely be posting them here. I may even try a trip report. Thinking to go lacto-ovo out of London, Oriental out of Singapore, then maybe Indian out of Brisbane, and lacto-ovo again back to London.

Personally, my default is VLML, with Indian and sometimes Oriental (i.e. Chinese) for variety. I avoid VGML - vegan - as that tends to be boring. If you have enough sectors, you should try the various meals at different sectors, as that will add more variety and give you an idea of which caterers do a better job at which meal type. For a while (this is back in the 80's and early 90's), the VLML meals out of Australia were excellent and consistently better than other stations. "

Who'd have thought I would be looking forward to airline food? lol I quite like being served first, a bonus for sure (it upsets my poor husband who is always hungry!), the only problem is when I'm finished they are still serving usually, and this can be a problem getting my tray collected. Though a lovely lady helped me last time when she saw me struggling to hold my tray and get out of my seat at the same time. "

I quite like the VLML, it's just that it can be a repeptitive - I think there are two meals on the first leg, and a meal on the second leg, and they are usually pasta based, with some kind of omelette for breakfast. I've done this a few times now (this is my third trip from LHR to BNE with SQ and it won't be the last), so probably a good time for a change. Gosh, if I was a business traveller I would have done that in a week, lol. "

Boiled Eggs in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5733-/page1," Throughout these years of flying multiple times on SQ F, I have never once ordered 'boiled eggs' when selecting egg dishes off the breakfast menu and always consider it worthless. My mentality towards 'boiled eggs' is one that is the cheapest and among the easiest to prepare and find it ""Why on earth should I pay for F and order something as cheap as boiled eggs when as long as I've got a stove and a boiling pan at home, I can make it myself with hardly any hassles?"" With scrambled or baked, at least they require more time for preparation and some skill involved in doing them thus I don't mind ordering them and have ordered so on several occassions off the F breakfast menu and quality also better. But c'mon with boiled eggs, why should I bother with it as a ""Main BF Dish"" when I paying $$$ for a F ticket? So I am curious what others think of ordering boiled eggs of the BF menu in F? Have you ordered them before or do you do so regularly? Do you feel it is worth having ordered boiled eggs for a F BF? "
Boiled Eggs in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5733-/page1," I would definitely order boiled eggs if I knew that they're runny and come with toast soldiers! Better any day than airline scrambled eggs made with powder or rubbery over poached eggs. As for whether it's value for money to order a boiled egg in F, I don't think it's an issue. IMO, the luxury of F is eating what I want and if I happen to feel like a boiled egg then, that's what it'll be. Why force myself to choose my 2nd choice merely because that 2nd choice is dearer or more complicated than my 1st choice ? Edit: it seems to perhaps be a peculiar English thing ? http://www.icons.org.uk/nom/nominations/eggandsoldiers Nevertheless, I certainly wouldn't complain if they served this in BA F for example. "
Boiled Eggs in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5733-/page1," If I like boiled eggs, I will order boiled eggs in F, whether I found it ""worth it"" or not. Obviously, if I didn't like boiled eggs, I would simply not order them. Plenty of people like it at breakfast even at home (when they could presumably make other egg dishes as they desired), so it is just another option that can cater for some people's preferences. Just like the ""Super Cheeseburger"" on NH F, it's about having the choice, and if people want it they can order it. No need to only offer things that are ""worthy"" of F. "
Boiled Eggs in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5733-/page1," PS. Some of the best tasting dishes (to me, anyway) do not involve any expensive ingredients or elaborate preparation - sometimes, simple noodles from a street stand can be exactly what you want right then, even if you have more than enough money to go to a 3* restaurant for a 7-course meal. Just like you can't have heavy and huge French dinners every day (well, you could, but you will balloon in size unrecognisably) and sometimes crave something very simple, I see nothing wrong with offering simply boiled egg in F because not everyone wants ""F-style"" food all the time. "

Why force myself to choose my 2nd choice merely because that 2nd choice is dearer or more complicated than my 1st choice ? Just a postscript to this. I flew NH longhaul F recently and had for breakfast ... out of the choice available on the amazingly wide ranging menu ... an orange juice, a bowl of cornflakes and a coffee. Thinking about it now, I wonder why I didn't go for the famous NH Super Cheeseburger (washed down with Krug) but at the time, it just felt right. "

Boiled Eggs in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5733-/page1, Which brings to mind a 1980s Air Canada TV ad where the punchline was about being able to order coddled eggs in F. (Yes AC had F then...)

Well I'm English and the most memorable food experience I had on my only Suites flight was a sudden craving for ice cream being addressed with some choc ices brought up from economy. They really hit the spot. 
Boiled Eggs in F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5733-/page1, Even in F I tend not to like scrambled eggs on a plane so would go for the boiled egg everytime. The nicest scrambled eggs I have ever had on a plane was in BA economy. Now normally BA economy scrambled eggs is totally inedible to me. So I guess this was more along the lines of an infinite numbers of monkeys given an infinite amount of time will produce the complete works of shakespear. Then it is only logical that a airline catering company producing huge quantities of scrambled eggs over a long number of years will eventually produce one that it nice.

What you can do is at time of booking If Your Birthday Coincides on the same day you are travelling let Singapore Airlines know about that and they will do something special for it. I have never been on a plane on my birthday but off the topic a little I was on a Cruise Ship sailing around the South Pacific Christmas 2007 and had a little group celebration for people all sharing birthdays on board 
Pictures Collection:  Special Cakes Aboard SQ,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/6455-/page2," Gosh I love SQ. I've switched to flying UA for the ~6 years I was in USA, mostly because SQ was always a lot more expensive. But I really wanted to fly SQ again, and someone from FT recommended a travel agent who got a good fare. So anyways, I flew on my birthday: JFK->FRA (Same cake as post 15 + 2 flutes of champagne, and I'm on ultra cheap economy type fares ) Was travelling alone so I drank all the champagne! FRA->SIN (Got a lovely looking chocolate cake that I haven't sampled yet, since I just got home hours ago lol) Service was impeccable, just the way I remember it. UA crew on the ORD/BOS->SIN flights have always been very competent, but they've never been so delightful and helpful in every way. I also won $30K in fake Krisworld casino money before I got bored. It's a pretty good birthday. "

I have always been impressed with the quality and attention to detail with SQ food in business and first, but they seemed to miss the point in the cheese department.

Great food in J - but to find good cheese is like gold...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7633-/page1, Absolutely agree. My husband is even more of a cheese fan than I but we both find the selection on SQ disappointing. The other day there was a pear paste (instead of quince paste) on the MEL-SIN leg and the hostesses asked him all about it as they had never had pear or quince paste before. Qantas usually have a great cheese (and wine selection) but alas they do not have those fully flat beds.

Definitely healthier than the fried rice and noodles offered as the standard option. Came with bread too. I sent it back as I didn't want any.

I have heard their catering is very good! Neither have i (for long haul), that is until october this year. My previous japan flights were always sq (save for those to and from korea which is normally ana or asiana). I was in NH's business class and to be fair I compared it with SQ's business class (though like you i fly mostly y). Quality is superior. I literally ate the food with growing smile as it was really unbelievable, which caused the stewardess approach me and said ""daijyoubu desuka/you're ok?"" I have to admit though, as a semi-veggie (fish and chicken are okay), the food selection in sq is superior. Book the cook has been especially helpful to me, though in Y, i've ended up with instant noodle several times. I've decided to fly ana again. In fact i've got one ana and one sq ticket to japan for next year. Back to topic, that luxury was common for sq in 1990/2000s. I remembered my lhr flights, it was always haagen dazs, though as recent as 2012 i got singapore sling ice cream which was very good. Nowadays I especially hate it when sq serve stick ice cream as i got sensitive teeth. "

I guess the side effect of getting a Michelin star, and all the publicity, is that queues are probably longer now than they were before. I have been eating a lot of ramen in Osaka this week. Even the regular ramen places like Kinryu Ramen, Ichiran Ramen are so delicious! I seem to be the only fan in my family of Kinryu Ramen (""Dragon"" Ramen...quick n cheap ramen in Dotonburi), whereas we all love Ichiran Ramen (We went to the one in Umeda). Haven't had a lot of udon or soba so far, but will be keeping a lookout for interesting places. I did have a spectacular cold udon as the final dish in an omakase meal at a small restaurant, Temra Matsu, in Arashiyama, just west of Kyoto last week, though! "

My favourite is Kagari in Ginza and Seirokuka in Tsukuba (Ibaraki Prefecture) (though I know it contains small amount of pork products but the majority of it is made of chicken) Enjoy your trip to Japan.

BTC selection help,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/5584-/page14," Hi SQTalkers, would any of you have any advice on the BTC choices ex-ZRH in Suites? I have a flight in a fortnight and would be keen to hear if there are any specific dishes you really liked / ZRH may be good for. FYI, I have had the Olma sausage (which was excellent) and salmon rösti (quite good) before, albeit in Business. Thanks so much! "

Is the meal better if we choose online?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/6022-/page1," According to my limited experiences......pre-select the seafood meal would be a better choice in Y class since although the normal meal provide choices of seafood, you meal would be different too. For example, in my HKG-SIN flight, the normal meal have a choice of Appetiser: Potato salad with ham Main course: Panfried fish in lemon butter sauce with vegetables and potatoes but my pre-booked seafood meal was different which include Appertiser: Smoked Tuna Salad Main course: Creamy Prawns and Scallops with vegatables and Pasta My observation is that if you book seafood meal, both appertiser and main course would contains seafood.

If you don't need to get out of the seat, just think about the people who would rather be eating than waiting for the cabin crew to serve up the meal.

According to my memory, in my CGK-SIN run, there was a guy sit in front of me ordered special meal, once he finiehed, he asked the FA to collect the tray however the FA refused (I don't know the reason), the guy then took his tray to the galley by himself and go back to his own seat. And on my last SIN-HKG leg, when the FA was on the Coffee/Tea run with the cart, one guy wanted to retuen his tray(Normal meal) but the FA asked him to wait.

There are 5 flights, as follows (in chronological order): SQ222 SYD-SIN : F SQ892 SIN-HKG : F SQ321 LHR-SIN : F SQ468 SIN-CMB : J SQ221 SYD-SIN : J (A380 - not sure if there are different choices for that??) Many thanks in advance for your thoughts and guidance on these. I am certainly looking forward to all the flights - BTC is (no pun intended) really the icing on the cake. "

I usually ordered it, but with the intention to let the lovely crew enjoy it, and I go for what's from the menu, especially after having many great foods at Singapore with good friends around... Lobster ex-SIN is my least preferred nowdays. It's too small and too many mushrooms in the sauce. Originally posted by jjpb3 View Post Ex-LHR F: lamb. I did try the pheasant ex-LHR. Too bland for me.

I actually ordered my BTC via the phone and as my access to the internet was down at the time I didn't see the actual menu. The SQ res staff only mentioned 'duck with rice' and so I took it. Thus when the FA told me that there'd be yam in the rice I was quite hesitant as I didn't know what on earth yam was - but it ended up being quite yummy. "
BTC planning,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3135-/page1," OK, thanks for all your help and suggestions so far. jhm was proved right in that having failed to narrow down my choices, some things that I don't particularly like have been mentioned - for example I'm not the world's biggest fan of lamb! Anyway, I have perused the BTC menu's and here is what I'm thinking about with some explanatory notes in italics: SYD-SIN - F This is the main daytime flight I've booked, so something that will fill me up, but doesn't necessarily have to be too light. Having tried the Lobster once already (ex-SIN), I think I might go with the Cantonese duck, although SQ LPP says the Lobster is good ex-SYD (that much better than ex-SIN?) - Lobster Thermidor with buttered asparagus, slow-roasted vine-ripened tomato, and saffron rice - Cantonese roast duck with vegetables and steamed rice SIN-HKG - F This is the shortest flight, so I can really indulge and try out the steak ex-SIN which might be too heavy for the longer flights. Is it to rave about, or are there other must-try's ex-SIN? This is my only ex-SIN F flight. - 8 oz. U.S.A. rib-eye steak LHR-SIN - F This is the late 10pm departure, so a light option is the order of the day to aid sleep (I will most probably eat before bed at the start of the flight). Seafood would be perfect, hence the choices. How's the Lobster ex-LHR? - Fried fillet of monkfish - Lobster Thermidor SIN-CMB - J This dish is just about on every menu, so with two ex-SIN J flights to go, I might as well try it out - it sounds like something I'd like. - Singapore Chicken Rice SIN-SYD - J The other ex-SIN J dish I was looking at. Might as well try it on this flight and find out what yam is (I don't know either)! - Braised soya-flavoured duck with yam rice Once again, thanks to everyone for their contributions! I will of course be TR'ing all these flights in my usual style! "
BTC planning,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3135-/page1," One quick question. In this post - is this chicken or duck? The post title says duck, the message says it's the Japanese chicken, it looks more like the duck though... Interesting also to see the decline between the two monkfish shots ex-LHR in Nov 05 and Feb 07! "
BTC planning,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3135-/page1, I think it's chicken. Don't you just love looking at pictures of food? I'm starting my flights this Fri! 
BTC planning,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/3135-/page1," A very good research you have done! Of course, SQFAN will be the right person to answer. But if I recall correctly from what I had tried, the first question is a roasted duck and rice. And yes, for different year, the presentation and preparation of the food might be different. Similar to beef bulgogi ex-LAX as well as ex-NRT. Rolled beef, then unrolled version. "

I have had Lobster thermidor so many times and thus want to try something new) First of all, just want to clear up the BTC lobster thermidor. It is only served in FC. For C class, it is slipper thermidor. Remember as well that the recommendation for meals are pretty much based on personal taste. There are things that I will not choose due to certain taste bud I have. Risotto is one of them! I will have the chorizo risotto, but certainly I will not eat the whole things. Chilean bass is nice, but for me I would rather have something fishier. And remember as well that fish tends to dry up quicker. Ex-SIN generally I will get the beef or lamb chops. And I know I am a real PITA, so when I board the plane I will tell the FAs that make sure my BTC beef or lamb chops are not overcooked, or indirectly saying turn down the oven temperature, or serve my meat first! Originally posted by danzer View Post ex-FRA: Beef Fillet Salmon Honey glazed duckling Since you take SQ25 and 26, it means that you can try two dishes, one for FRA-JFK and one for FRA-SIN. From the website: Artichoke-tomato crusted loin of lamb in thyme sauce, French beans with bacon, and gratin potatoes Gratinated prawns with mushrooms in brandy sauce, carrots, green beans, and dill potatoes Pan-fried fillet of beef in three peppercorn sauce with garden vegetables and roasted potatoes Roast chicken breast in rosemary sauce with vegetables and country potatoes Salmon gratinated with feta and parmesan cheese in orange ginger sauce with vegetables and Mississippi rice Chicken in Thai masaman curry with vegetables and steamed rice Fish in Thai red curry with vegetables and steamed rice Honey glazed duckling with vegetables and Chinese egg noodles I love the lamb with artichoke crusted for sure. The beef is not that bad neither. The strangest thing is that it seems both chicken and fish Thai curries are good. I was not enjoying the salmon though, perhas due to the feta and the rice. Originally posted by danzer View Post ex-JFK: Sea Bass Rack of Lamb Chilean Bass Beef Short-ribs Thanks for your time.. Per website: Grilled shrimps and scallops in tarragon mustard sauce with leeks, carrots, and linguini Pan-fried chicken in green peppercorn sauce, squash, and creamy mashed potatoes Pan-fried fillet of beef in three peppercorn sauce with green vegetables and roasted potatoes Roasted sea bass with wilted spinach and glazed crab-mashed potatoes Roast rack of lamb with natural jus, roasted vegetables, and creamy garlic mash Baked Chilean bass in Oriental XO sauce with mixed vegetables and fried rice Braised short-ribs of beef in Chinese wine and five-spice with mixed vegetables and egg noodles Stir-fried chicken in Chinese wine with seasonal vegetables and chicken flavoured rice I must have liked lamb too much. Always order the lamb from JFK as well. But yes, the alternative would be the fish, but sometimes get dried often. Thus the Chilean bass would be a better choice of fish since it serves with the XO sauce. Note: Well, from JFK usually I go early to be at VS Clubhouse. Thus, my other dinner would be at the lounge. I know that as C pax you will be in different lounge, unless you are a Solitaire, or being guested by other who has access to VS CH. In short, with four sectors of your flight that allows you to do BTC, you can be adventurous by having different one for all the segmens. For example, beef for SIN - FRA, lamb for FRA - JFK, Chilean bass for JFK - FRA, and chicen curry for FRA - SIN. "

So can we use BTC but then deside to have a meal on the normal menu? When do they serve dinner can we decide what time or is it set? CAn we have as many drinks as we like. If so does this include Champain and beer ect Do we have to wait for them to bring drinks or can we ask for drinks when we want? What about nibbles if we are hungry between meals? Sorry about the lost of question but as you can see we are new to this. Thanks Skooby

Pray tell where. It would be a nice break from the standard American b/f. Originally posted by HUGE AL Don't know where you're eating, but this is not true at all... Many of the places where I eat breakfasts (mostly hotels) tend to serve scrambled eggs. And when I do ask for sunny-side up, they would put it into a griller after they fried it, to cook the top. Ends up the yolk is fairly firm unlike the runny style that I prefer. I've also not seen an airline serve a sunny-side up (perhaps I'm not in F ). When McDonalds cook their McMuffin, the egg is thoroughly done, eventhough they try to make it look like a fried eggs. Not true.. plenty of places like Ihop would do sunny-side-up or over easy. Never seen soft boil eggs in the US yet though. Haven't eaten at an Ihop yet. I need to clarify I'm not saying that there're absolutely no establishment in the US that serves runny eggs. That would be a absolutely incorrect. One of my favourite b/f places is Houston's Buffalo Grill and they do serve easy done sunny-side up and of course their signature crispy peppered bacon. The other place would be the Waffle House chains. The commonality in both these places is that ""healthy"" food is definitely not on the menu. Or perhaps, they get ""cleaner"" eggs? Indeed my exposure to American food is not all that wide, and I do stand corrected. On a side note, I read here that the FDA is a tad more conservative in their recommendation on cooking eggs than what is practiced in Singapore (and Italy for their Tiramisu?). There's an inference that eggs ought to be treated similarly like raw chicken. Any professional/trained chefs here? "

Special Meal Request on economY SQ (Seafood Meal),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7802-/page1," Hi all, I've been a long-time lurker around here and finally like to post a question to all you knowledgeable SQ flyers. I'm wondering if anyone has tried requesting the special Meal in Y and how did it taste like. Please state the meal type and a comment (i.e. food content, tastiness etc). If you have ever booked the ""seafood"" or ""hindu"" meals, a reply would be a plus. Thanks "

The main was always fish (once was salmon and the other was some white fish) with some sort of seafood salad. The food's pretty ok and its also quite light compared to the ones that they serve on board. And best of all, you get to eat before everyone else. "

Breakfast was always a Dim Sum (yes, even in Y) which I love... Never tried the seafood selection though... "

SQ955 CGK-SIN (06/2008) Lunch Totally overdone...like easting a eraser... SQ859 HKG-SIN (02/2009) Lunch Good Quality and Portion, very creamy sourse and fresh prawns and scallop SQ862 SIN-HKG (02/2009) Brunch Just average but the starter was good SQ1 HKG-SIN (04/2009) Breakfast Perfectly done but with tastless mushrooms... SQ870 SIN-HKG (04/2009) Dinner Fairly done but the potato cake next to the fish was delicoius! SQ1 HKG-SIN (07/2009) Breakfast Same as 04/2009's one...But you can clearly see it is Salmon+White Fish+Prawn+Scallop+Vegetables SQ856 SIN-HKG (07/2009) Brunch Totally tastless this time... I agree with msndelevium, the seafood meal from SIN is normally fish + rice/mash. I think it is quite boring, and those from HKG were quite good. PS: SQ ex-HKG is using Cathay Pacific Catering Service, however the meals on SQ flights are far better than those on CX flights (Taste, Appearence, Quality), possibly SQ choose the more expensive meals "

Special Meal Request on economY SQ (Seafood Meal),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-catering-and-amenities/singapore-airlines-catering/7802-/page1," Thought this LOW-SODIUM special Y request meal might be of interest to some... Direct link (with photo) here: http://eatbma.blogspot.com/2009/11/s...of-taipei.html It's quite short so I'll quote verbatim - Ugh - that was nasty. My last two special meals on SQ were a lot better than I thought they would be, but this one tasted just like what the words ""low sodium"" invoke: bland and unappetizing. Sadly, this featured tasteless pieces of chicken breast in both the appetizer as well as the main course, and they even left the third plastic tray empty - as if they couldn't find anything else to put in there. I wonder if this was because of the local caterer in Taiwan? The ironic thing is that I had to add some of the standard issue table salt and butter that came with the roll on the side in order to make it half-bearable. So much for eating healthy. "

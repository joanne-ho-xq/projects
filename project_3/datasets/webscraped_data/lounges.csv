[SIN] SIN SQ Lounge Access & Overnight Questions,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5268-/page4," Originally posted by BigTop View Post Hi all, I'll be flying in on SQ979 arriving at 10pm and then SQ118 (6:45pm) the following day. I know, sounds crazy, but I'm on a mileage run. Being a *G, I understand that I can enter the KF Gold lounges (EYCL BP). Are the two KF G lounges ideal for overnighting? Or am I better off at the transit hotel? Thing is, I'm having problems with my credit card and can't make a reservation so I'm worried it'll be full when I do a walk-in booking. IIRC they are 24 hours but do yourself a favour an get a room at the transit hotel. Your chances are higher at T1 for a walk-in. You don't even get to shower at the KF Gold lounges. At least at the hotel you get a real bed, some privacy and your own washroom. Plus, you get to take a dip at the T1 rooftop pool. "

Still don't know why they have them. My dear, why are you so concerned about B&O? If LH puts the new ""wallmart"" brand tv and other electronic product in their FCL and FCT, wouldn't it be too off for the image and the style? I love FCL and FCT. Those B&O just blend in and make a great interior design. Match with the bar and the restaurant style dining area. So I guess you don't like Grand Hyatt Singapore with the B&O tv and phone in the room. "

They go for US$22,000 a piece. Now I'm not saying B&O is bad. In fact, I love B&O. I'm just thinking from more of a financial standpoint. They look quite good in the picture here and in the other one, but I'm thinking about the one I saw at LHR. It was just sitting in a corner against a white wall. Maybe that's what has trumatized me...seeing such a great piece of art just neglected like that. "
"[FRA] LH - First Class Lounge (Concourse B, next to Casino)",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/534-/page1," I think its all about product placement. Certainly the F lounge that LH maintains is a major statement by LH about the quality, style, and luxury they offer to the super premium passengers that pay F fares. Its entirely possible that LH received those TV's for free, or at least very discounted. From B & O's perspective its fantastic advertising and its understandable to me at least why the two brands would want to be associated. "

But in T3, the first door will be for crew or Elite Gold check-in counters. Or in another words, missed the First Class ramp. "

If you have check-in bags, the porter will take care of your bags. If you travel with just hand luggage, you can just follow the satff who will direct you where to go. Basically, you can check in at the desk, or the staff will check you in, and you wait at one of the chairs available at the lounge. For example, this gentleman got checked-in by the staff and he did not need to go to the counter/desk. And for me, since I have more tedious check-in process as always , I prefer to sit face to face with the friendly and helpful staff. And as you can see, there are still many more empty desk where the staff can check you in. You see as well that the staff is excellent (much better than the old T2 in my oipnion) and she and I had a good time in conversation. As you see below, the sticker still exists. It's tampered-proof. But it has a different meaning. The sticker will let the pax to go through the special immigration line (fast track). "

First Class Check-In Lounge is land side. Yes, I have seen pax (whose taxi dropped them off in the regular door) walked back from the departure check-in hall. This is the door from inside... I stood facing the FC Immigration entrance. The FC Check-in lounge is behind me. To the right of me (left hand side on the picture, you see part of check-in row that at the moment has not been used yet.) The person who walked into the lounge in the background turned right to find the rows of check-in desks (inside the FC Ck-In lounge).

Originally posted by dnllam View Post Is it walkable from the Crowne Plaza hotel beside Terminal 3? The hotel is not opened yet.

No desk for the lounge dragon. She will sit where there is an empty chair, or just stand.

[FRA] LH Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8330-/page3," On SQ26 at FRA, it might not be worth the hassle to move from C to B and back to C again during that 1.5 hour transit just to use the SEN lounge at B43. You have to clear security once when going to the C16 SEN lounge and once when you are heading to the gate at C4.

Noob question about lounges and virgin clubhouse,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4048-/page1," From LHR - 1. Yes, there is Fast Track for departure security screening (and also for arrivals immigrations, if you're in F or J on the way back). 2. You can visit the Virgin Clubhouse if you're travelling in F or J on an SQ flight, so in this case I would think that you would have access. No guests, though.

I cannot find anything about this on SQTalk or articles on web only seem to refer directly to clubhouses. I am flying on VS from Del to LHR. Virgin Atlantic lists the Plaza Premium Lounge as its lounge at Delhi Airport. As a KrisGold flying on Virgin will I be entitled to access to the Plaza Premium Lounge at Del? Will I also be entitled to any other benefits such as priority check in or luggage?

From the latest PPS Club News: Lets hope they completely redesign the SKL F side at T3 as that lounge is so underwhelming/boring/crap (for an F lounge) that it's ridiculous for a flagship lounge. Dear Mr MAN Flyer, As a PPS Club member, your every journey on Singapore Airlines is designed for greater comfort. Now, we have gone to even greater lengths to bring you the comfort of home in our new-concept SilverKris Lounge in Sydney. The new SilverKris Lounge was conceptualised by renowned architectural and interior design firm ONG&ONG, following extensive research that included focus groups with customers. The lounge features a customized screen, with a batik design signature of Singapore Airlines unique heritage. It also picks up on some familiar elements of home  including a cosy living room area and private spaces for rest and relaxation. Unwind in the distinctive SIA armchair, or work in the privacy of specially designed productivity pods. The taste of home is never far away, wherever home may be  with Singapore favourites such as laksa and mee siam, as well as a selection of fine cuisine from around the world. An array of beverages, including premium wine and spirits, are also available for your choosing. And you can always be assured of the warmth and care of our friendly staff, who are on hand to assist you with your travel needs. Over the next five years, this new design will be introduced to SilverKris Lounges in 15 cities. Planning is underway to upgrade lounges in London, Hong Kong, and Singapore (Terminal 3) next year. We look forward to welcoming you on board again soon, and to your home away from home at the new-concept SilverKris Lounge in Sydney. Yours sincerely, Shirlene Teo Manager Loyalty Marketing "

[SFO] SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13111-/page1," As part of a trip to Europe and the USA in June this year, I visited the SilverKris Lounge in SFO. This lounge is smallish, but no smaller than the lounges operated by many other non-USA based airlines at SFO. Apart from seating and work areas, there was a buffet with a limited selection of hot and cold dishes, as well as a self service bar area. This lounge has good views of the tarmac. Refreshments... The lounge also served a Singapore specialty, mee siam... It was fairly full when I was there. Overall impressions... A comfortable but unexceptional lounge with what you would expect from a lounge in an overseas location, but not offering any more than the basics. I would have thought that a flagship destination like SFO would have a larger, more impressive lounge (Look at Sydney, for example). Perhaps there are space constraints at SFO. I for one would probably head for the United Club the next time (or check out any of the other A* lounges in SFO), simply because it is much larger, even if the catering or beverage selection isn't as large.

I just got the towel from the reception, then waited near one of the shower. Then it becomes first come first serve basis, or after whoever is nearby and has a towel and was there before me. Shower was not cleaned after each use. EVA lounge was also very full during SQ1 hours. I only remembered that EVA lounge has wings.

[SIN T3]  SKL F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3294-/page4," i was wondering if you can invite a passenger in to the F lounge, if you yourself are but you are not a *Gold or PPS and the passenger is traveling on Economy? "
[SIN T3]  SKL F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3294-/page4," Passengers travelling in F can bring one guest into the lounge. Officially, the rule is that the guest needs to be also travelling on Star Alliance, but in practice the enforcement of this rule varies (since quite often the lounge attendant will not check the guest's boarding pass) "
[SIN T3]  SKL F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3294-/page4, My very brief visit on 8APR... The entrance with the greeters... I rushed to take a shower first - I needed it after LHR-SIN in whY!! The wash basin in the shower room Some shots of the lounge area The non-operational bar...!! Apparently it opens for a whopping 2 and half hours every day (2100-2330). Even the SKL at ICN manages to have an open bar in the J section from 3pm onwards... The dining area Some of the food offerings - the salmon and some cold hams Fried rice and pasta (if memory serves correctly) The chef station where fresh egg dishes are prepared 
[SIN T3]  SKL F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3294-/page4," ======================== Some comments: 1. Generally, I was not particularly wowed by it. It struck me as just an ordinary lounge with each part slightly upgraded, for example the food offering slightly improved compared to other normal lounges. There was no innovation of any sort, a-la-VS CH or FRA FCT etc, or even the HKG Wing F section (gosh, how old is that lounge?) 2. I did witness some degree of the ""eager attendants"" syndrome, although nowhere near as bad as some others have indicated. However, I found it striking that they really spoke no English at all - couldn't they have paid a bit more for attendants who could also actually help you find things like such as a fork? 3. The shower room was pretty good, though I had a feeling of deja-vu from lounges as old as the circa-2000 ""new"" UA RCC at NRT. Thankfully the temperature and water pressure was fine despite some reports to the contrary. As a lounge, it's fine - I mean, there's nothing really to ""fault"" it as such. However, considering that this is the year 2008, and the SKL F at T2 opened eons ago, it seems to me that nothing has improved in real terms at all - in fact, I would go as far as to say the new SKL is far behind the current generation of lounges, whereas the SKL T2 at the time of opening was probably quite ground-breaking. Obviously SQ has quite a number of F passengers and TPPs ex-SIN so you can't really have LH-style FCT without it getting totally ridiculous, but you would have thought that the VS CH at LHR would have been a viable model to aim for... "
[SIN T3]  SKL F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3294-/page4," SQ ! Stingy Quack Really SQ.... There are NO printers connected to any of the numerous PCs because SQ feels that many people were printing uneccessarily and thus wasting paper. So one or a few people have spoiled it for the rest of us who genuinely need one. Somehow I am not wowed by any of it . In the F or the C lounge. SQ had the perfect opportunity to emulate BA/QF at T1, and it failed miserably. "

[AMS] Upcoming report about SKL AMSTERDAM NL,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5442-/page1," Hello everybody! As a Dutch based traveller i usually find the information about SQ-activities in the Netherlands quite non-excistent on the internet so i decided to start doing some posts here about SQ in the Netherlands and about my upcoming SQ travel. I will travel the 17th december 2008 on SQ 323 in business class (J) so i will have access to the SKL Amsterdam. I've been there before twice: 1) when i was about 10 yrs old, my mom knew the checkin supervisor when SQ still had their own ground staff in Amsterdam. She managed to received an invitation for her family into the SKL even though flying in Y without any FFP-status 2) when graduated from senior high, i got the choice of a Breitling watch or flying as chaperone with grandma on SQ from AMS-SIN-SOC in Rafless Class vv. as a graduation present. Needless to say my natural curiosity about what happens behind the curtain when it closes inflight made me choose instantly for the latter option! Unfortunatly it was the age of no digital cameras so i don't have any pictures of it! SQ website gives this as information about SKL Amsterdam: http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...es/skl_ams.jsp Welcome to SilverKris Lounge - Amsterdam Take a break from your travels - come and enjoy our SilverKris Lounge. Take advantage of the following: A well-equipped business centre Phone lines for laptop Internet access A wide variety of hot and cold drinks and premium alcoholic beverages A self-service food buffet, including instant noodles, fruit salads, Dutch cookies, and nuts Location Amsterdam Schiphol Airport First Level Between Pier F and E (Airside) Major Facilities Internet Access Luggage Area TV Area Lounge Access (based on departing flight) First Class Business Class Singapore Airlines PPS Club, Solitaire Singapore Airlines PPS Elite Gold, Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer Star Alliance Gold (please refer to respective membership guides for access conditions) Opening Hours Daily: 0750 to 1150 hours (subject to flight schedule changes) Recalling from my mermories i still remember: 1) Both times the loungedragon was the same tall almost giant blond elder woman who was very friendly in both english and dutch. She asked every guest if she can show the facilities and i did remember she made flight announcments. 2) During my first stay i noticed a very tall decorated christmas tree and christmas adornements across the lounge (we were traveling in the x-mas season then) 3) It's kind of a hike to the SKL when travelling with grandma. It took at least a 15 min walk and ellevator usage because it is on the 2nd level of terminal 3 departures. SQ usually departs from the G-gates which is in elderly terms almost walking the marathon from the SKL. Luckly the lounge dragon called forth a chariot (the cart) so we were driven off to our gate 4) The entrance looks dark but the SilverKris logo is immensely lit-up visible behing the lounge dragon's desk 5) Drinks included alchoholic as far as i remember Bailey's, Grand Marnier and red / white wine. Softdrinks were available canned from the fridges. Water was bottled in Evian and Perrier. Napkins and wedges of lemons were available. Coffee and hot water were available from machines as well as an assortiment of different tea bag flavours. All was self-service. Cutlery surprisingly was of First Class; the heavy silver/steel like ones. (I still have some in drawers at home, i was allowed to take those when i asked politly kinda embarrassed) 6) Foodwise, Dutch stroopwafels and other biscuits were available and instant cupnoodles. I can't remember clearly if sandwiches were offered but i do know no hot foods were available. (As SQ leaves mornings from AMS and the Dutch usually have a continental breakfast, hot foods would be kind of a waste) 7) Lounge had dark blue sofas, 4 grouped around a round table. Toilettes are available inside the lounge and the handtowels were soft fluffy ones and not of the brown recyclable sawdust paper variety at Amsterdam airport. The 17th December 2008 i will visit this lounge again with mr. Allegro25 Sr. Are there any special requests or details i should photograph, observe, ask, try, write about etc. for you guys? I know Amsterdam is only a secondary EU-destination city so this SKL might not be visited that often by others but nevertheless i still think it deserves to be spotlighted. Moreover after a quick search on google i found out SQ is the ONLY star alliance carrier with its own lounge at AMS making it automatic the only *G lounge available at Ams. If internet is available i will try to post directly from the lounge itself on the 17th. "

Originally posted by fimo View Post Same here, the SKL there may not be much to write home about, but I'll take AMS over most other major EU gateways in a heartbeat! My last experience at AMS was embarassing.... I disembarked from a SQ flight, one of the first to be out of the plane. There were immigration officers at the end of the aerobridge. Stopped me and ask to look at my passport. The first officer opened the passport, saw that I had many stamps, EU and others in the pages, began taking a closer look. He then passed it on to another more senior officer, who was really scrutinising it, even with magnifying glass, on the photgraph page. Stood there for half an hour, with them questioning me as to the reasons for the frequent trips etc etc, I was not even going into Holland, it was a transit stop. I was in a hurry too as i have a next flight to catch..... passengers who were disembarking were staring at me, wondering what criminal offence I had committed etc etc... pissed off. One time I had to catch a flight from Amsterdam, I took a train from Antwerp to the airport. Going through security, I was stopped and was given a thorough search, with dogs....damned.... I don't know, but Amsterdam is not the airport for me..... maybe I have this oriental drug courier look...... try as much, I will avoid Amsterdam unless necessary. "
[AMS] Upcoming report about SKL AMSTERDAM NL,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5442-/page1," SO OP, Any pics of the SKL in AMS? Will be flyign through there in a month's time and it's the first time I am using SQ from AMS to SIN (company normally flies me on KL or AF due to ongoing agreements). IMHO, AMS is probably the best EU hub as compared to CDG (which I hate with a passion), FRA or CPH (not sure why I am not a fan of CPH, maybe it's because it looks like Ikea had a hand in the overall design 50 years ago...). THe only down side if you are a smoker, AMS has a tiny smoking ""box"" in the non-Schengen area. However, if you have access to the KLM Crown Lounge then there is a smoking area there... "

The lounge will be ready on September 25 but goes into operation from September 9. Harry Chu, SIA public relations manager for Hongkong, said the facility would be around twice the size of the existing lounge with a classier new design. Extra space for computer terminals and workstations has been included but there will be no shower facilities. Improved catering can be expected, Chu said. Since most of our departures are directly out of Hongkong, we found there was no demand for showers and so we have used the space for other amenities. The new lounge will be able to host around 210 passengers at a time and will be open from 6am until 10.30pm. It is situated next to the current lounge opposite gate 15 in the departures area. For further details about SIAs lounges and Hongkong services, visit www.singaporeair.com Kenny Coyle "

Anyone who stressed out from rush hour traffic instead of using the train to the airport chose that additional stress. It's a poorly worded statement: I bet Mr Chu meant SQ found little demand for showers from their own passengers who depart from Hong Kong. "

[HKG] SKL at HKIA (post-renovation),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3208-/page4," I still think regardless of whatever the demand is, there's always the expectation that there's a shower in an SKL. I walk into every single one of them thinking there's a certain standard that applies. There's a ""standard look"", and a standard ""feel"". And that's part of the experience - I'm at home before I board. I fire up my laptop, and there's a wireless network waiting for me. I go to the fridge, there's a diet coke waiting for me I go the toilet - and there ought to be a shower waiting for me (KUL aside). Never thought to ask if these things were available before - you just expected it. Now, having to consider these things, which I never had to consider before.... "
[HKG] SKL at HKIA (post-renovation),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3208-/page4," For a much-touted A380 hub charging Suites pax R fares ex-HKG, it should not matter. On the off-chance that an R pax wants a shower, they should by all means have at least one stall available in HKG. Even if its a unisex one. You really wonder sometimes who they get to give statements like that... someone from PR should've been all over that - better to not say it at all than say that, in my opinion. "

This is actually pretty outrageous. But for me it actually gets even worse since I need to take a connecting flight to Miami (AA272). Since there is no arrival lounge at SFO (or any lounge for that matter) I won't shower for over 24 hours... Sshhh... "
[HKG] SKL at HKIA (post-renovation),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3208-/page4," I visited the renovated lounge for the first time today. I must say that I'm disappointed with the changes. The positives are the ambience feels better and not so dated; and the lounge size is greatly expanded, almost doubled. But to me, the negatives outweigh. As pointed out, there's no shower facilities - heck, they do not even have toilet facilities. You have to go next door to the public toilet. This is a major letdown. I also wonder whether its necessary to have such a large space. The lounge is less than 30% full during the few hours I was in transit here. I also feel let down by the First Class section. SIA carved off a small space (accounting for say, <20% of total space) for First Class sitting. But the ventilation in that area is poor - it feels stuffy. Its also a long walk from the common food / buffet area. So you're better off sitting in the common area. The magazine racks are also poorly designed. You have to stoop very very low to discern the title of the magazines. I do not see any difference in the variety of food, compared to the old SKL. But the main grouse I have will be the lack of toilet and shower facility. What I did was that I went to the Thai and United Airlines lounge near Gate 60 for a shower. Its a 10 minute detour each way - but if you need to freshen up, at least there's still a place (far away) you can go. "

Access really depends on the staff you speak to. Capacity control is often invoked as an excuse, and unfortunately they're well within the rules to do so.

[DUS] Open Sky Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15355-/page1," Recently took SQ337 for the first time on my trip back from Düsseldorf to Singapore. As J passages I had access to the Open Sky Lounge in the non-Schengen Pier C. The lounge is situated centrally in the pier, while reaching the gate was quick and easy. The lounge itself was rather underwhelming and I only spend about 15min there before walking over to the gate. It is open daily from 5:15am to 9:00pm. Facilities include limited selection of drinks, very few hot and cold dishes, Wifi, and newspapers and magazines. The Open Sky Lounge is basically a pay-per-visit lounge and you get access with the following partners: Priority Pass - Lounge Club - Lounge Key - Lounge Pass - Diners Club Overall, this lounge is nothing too special and I would not recommend to come early to the airport to spend time in the lounge. My overall experience at DUS was quite positive, ways a relatively short, wait times were minimal and we departed more or less on schedule. Have you been to DUS and the Open Sky Lounge? How was your experience? "

Yes, SQ is using terminal C, which is the non-Schengen pier of the airport. If I recall correctly, my gate was C31.

If I recall correctly, my gate was C31. Boarding was very disorganized as there was hardly enough space for passengers waiting for boarding to start. Very interesting. Up until at least the end of January, SQ has always used Terminal A. It also has (or had) a non-Schengen section at the very end which is/was used by LH and EW primarily. There were some issues with Terminal A in that the LH lounges are located in the Schengen area of Terminal A and SQ were issuing letters to all passengers with lounge access reminding them to allow minimum times to pass through immigration. I think the design of DUS is the issue with the gate crowding as the A gates were similarly problematic. The ends of the piers have a square footprint but connect planes onto the corners, whereas most airports use some kind of circular or polygonal expansion in floor space to facilitate that. "

Originally posted by kapitan View Post Is there a smoking room in the lounge, there was one previously....... kapitan, sorry to be the bearer of bad news...there is no smoking room. Quick overview then...it has a *G sign outside, so should be open to pax on other *A carriers. As stargold mentioned, it has no separate F section. It is surprisingly roomy and airy compared to the OZ J/*G lounge, with apron views. Two thirds of the lounge are 'open roofed', with the remaining third tucked away and feeling a little more cozy...and closer to the restrooms and showers. Of everything there seems to be pairs: two unisex showers (sans toilets, spacious and light though), two gents sinks, two gents pissoirs, two gents toilets...a choice of two sandwiches, two buffet mains, two snacks, two WiFi access points...there is a choice of three cheeses and four beers though. No champagne, no cognac...but Bombay Sapphire is available. And lots more drinks to choose from. Chilean red and white wine, Cava, Campari, Bacardi, Absolut, and Chivas. Pepsi, not Coke. I personally prefer the catering and showers (avec toilets) in the KE lounge...the drink quality and food quality (catered by Hyatt Incheon) are just better. Drink selection is much smaller though. Reading material for English speakers is better at the SKL though... Makes a case for lounge hopping with PP. And dang, it's pretty fresh throughout ICN airport today...wish I didn't pack my jacket away in SHE. Update: just tried the showers...way better than the OZ or KE concourse ones. Makes the SKL my new favorite concourse lounge. Let's hope the catering gets improved a lil. And if the lounge feels cold, head to tucked away part. Much warmer in there. Update 2: the lounge is located on the KE lounge and transfer desk side...it's a slightly longer walk to the *A transfer desk and gates. "

Does anyone know how far ahead in advance one can check in at LHR T2 for an SQ flight (now that they have *A collective check in) so as to maximize time at the Silver Kris lounge? 3 hours? 4 hours? or Indefinite? 
New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page4," You should be able to check in on the day of your flight as long as SQ has check-in desks open. They open their desks three hours before a flight. Depending on the time of day, they have flights leaving roughly every three hours from LHR, so you should be able to check in up to six hours before your flight, at least. The SilverKris Lounge may not even be open yet, though, so I don't know if you'll really be able to maximise your time there. "

They've been kicking the can down the road for a few years now, especially for TPR as that was originally supposed to be done a couple of years ago with it being changed to having sectioned off 'Private Rooms' and should have been done and dusted It does appear that SQ have finally managed to get more space from Changi so the size and floor area of the lounges will increase as well. The main decision now is supposedly how long they close them for, with one suggestion they could be closed for up to a year. What is not in doubt is both TPR and the SKL's are in need of a big upgrade. For an airline that still likes to think itself at the top of the tree the current offerings are nowhere near good enough.

Lufthansa has separate Senator and Business Lounges at their hubs, and while I have not been to their Business Lounges, the Senator Lounges (for Star Gold) are far superior to the equivalent Star Gold lounges at SQ's home base in Singapore. In fact, LH allows Star Gold to use their First Class check-in counters (not the First Class Terminal though) whereas for SQ Star Gold is lumped with Business Class check-in. "

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page20," Originally posted by yongchau View Post maybe its bcos of the timing u enter the lounge, i went to KrisFlyer Gold lounge at T3 with my SIA Business Class boarding pass at 3pm in the afternoon. the lady let me in most probably bcos there were only 2 people in the lounge at the time and was very quiet, same for T2 and T3's Silver Kris Lounge. So if you want to take nice pics of the lounge, go in the afternoon and not at night when it is so crowded. I thought only Krisflyer Gold or Star alliance gold cardmembers can enter the KF G lounge but wanted to try and enter to have a look and I asked if I can go in and showed my J boarding pass and she let me in...so happy! The food at T2's SKL Business Class section is really bad and not much variety compared to KF G's and T3's for lunch. The standard is really bad in T2, no more Haagen Daz ice-cream either. KG G's and T3's SKL Business Class section's food is so much better. SKL in T2 is indeed scary - they cut everything. I am surprised there are still fish in the fish tanks. SKL in T3 has seen cutting of all juices to orange and apple only. "

FRA is a well spread airport with several *A lounges. The 'best' one is probably the one nearest your gate. Q2. BNE will be a T3 departure so you are hardly likely to go back across the T2. Q3.

I suppose this is a hybrid design since I can see that they have retained the high back chairs with orchid motif found in the newer overseas SKL. Is there a F class section? Any one knows how the newly renovated OZ lounge compares to SKL? The newly renovated OZ Lounge is like the old OZ Lounge. Ther are no changes to design and setup, somone who is not visiting frequently would not even notice that it was renovated. Even the old SKL was already superior. Now with the new bar concept and (to my feeling) elevated food presentation definelty there is no question where to go. There is no F section. "

Quite centrally located. Once you reach the top of the escalator, you will see lots of DFS goods strewn all over the place. It's a packing and delivery zone for all DFS purchases. It's a mess, and isnt the most welcoming scene before you reach the lounge. It's the same situation for OZ's Central Business Class lounge. Fortunately, the entrance to the lounge is across an overhead bridge and away from the mess. Entrance Batik motifs on the ceiling leading to the lounge. Rest of the lounge was bright and spacious. It did get a little crowded as the evening passed, but seats remained plentiful (but this could be because the load on SQ603 was quite light that night) Food was very good and beautifully presented. Better than SKL MNL, but not as varied as LHR. Overall a much better place to relax before your flight compared to the OZ lounge. "

The style and design for LH F as well as LX F seems too similar, especially the sofa (except the lounger at LH F). The food and drinks for LH F seems having more varieties. FRA LH F staff seems more eager to serve, but not for LX F here. Well, I was at LH F MUC today, and the staff was not eager to serve like in FRA. Regarding driven to the plane, yes, I was driven today all the way to the remote airplane parking.

By your logic why have a lounge anywhere outside SIN as almost every flight ends up there?. The length of the flight dictates what is served on board, which in the case of KUL is virtually nothing. NRT is a *A hub and they must deem the NH lounge to be decent enough, unlike TG's lounges at BKK.

Marketing Bumpf from LH As of the beginning of April 2008, a Senator Café is available to you at Munich Airport in the EU departure area of terminal 2. The modern 150m² café and bar equipped with 48 seats offers you another area to work and relax in, in addition to the space currently provided by the Senator Lounge. The atmosphere conveys warmth and hospitality, and a barista guarantees professional and custom-prepared coffee enjoyment. When you're just a little hungry, there are light snacks as well as healthy fruit smoothies and salads available on the way to the gate. With this new concept, Lufthansa is starting extensive modernization and expansion measures for the current EU lounges in Munich, which will be finished by the end of 2009. The Senator Café is centrally located near Gate G27 across from the current Senator Lounge, and is open daily from 5am to 10pm. "

I also noticed that the Japanese businessmen like drinking: even at 9am, I saw a lot of them downing glasses of beer, and some were having whiskey & other mixed drinks.

KIX lounge for SQ,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12719-/page1, I can't find any up-to-date info on the KIX lounge here and am getting conflicting info from the *A and SQ websites. *A says that PPS pax flying Y have to use the Thai lounge but SQ's website says that their nominated lounge is JAL Sakura.

My question is if I will be granted access to the Asiana first class lounge at ICN with my SQ603 Business Class BP and a 'used' LH718 First Class BP? I am an AC SE *Gold which doesn't matter in this case I think...

[ICN] OZ - Asiana Lounge (First Class),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/531-/page1," The reason I am asking is that my understanding of Asiana Lounge at ICN are actually are an OZ aka *A lounges, therefore should be abide by *A rules. The rules are clearly explained that '*A First Class Lounge' access are given to those passangers holding a First Class *A BP within the 24 hours period. What happen is that the First Class BP flew from my state of origin are within the 24 hours period and connecting to a regional flight that have no First class. The question is am I not included into that *A passenger holding a same day *A First class BP the rule mentioned? "
[NRT] NH - ANA Lounge (First Class),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/457-/page3, overnight at NH lounge Have some silly questions about NRT NH lounge: 1. Is that possible to stay overnight at NH F lounge? or even at NH J lounge? Planning arrive with SQ12 at 17.20 and leaving with LH711 (10.30) or NH209 (12.30) next day. 2. Are the slumberette room at NH F or J lounge is sleepable like at FRA LH FCT or BKK TG F lounge? or it's just a cradle seat like at SQ T2 SKL F? 3. Is NH F lounge accessable for LH F or any other *A F pax plus 1 guest? Thanks for any responses....

Lounge in JFK,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3870-/page1, I used the Oasis lounge in the end 
Lounge in JFK,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3870-/page1," I just got back last month from New York. Took SQ25 for the first time and used the Oasis lounge too. I liked it. Comfortable seats, not as crowded as EWR's SAS lounge I use before catching SQ21. It is long and rectangular in shape and consists 4 areas (from left to right as you enter the lounge): computer room, TV room, buffet and library/drawing room. All areas have beautiful runway views. At the far right are the restrooms and shower facilities. Food is OK. What I don't understand is the number of SQTalkers who eat a lot in lounges. I don't want to spoil my appetite for the in flight food! Unless I plan to skip the meal and sleep ( usually red eye flights) Downside is that the lounge is before security, and I had to compete with passengers on 2 Air India flights to LHR and Mumbai. A real scrum! "

Oasis was fine though more seasoned travelers may disagree. Asian airports I frequent are much more modern and spacious and I'm happy to browse the shops, or find a cafe a ""people watch"".

There are four or five staff serving in here, which was a bit much initially as I was the only one in for a while. There is a number of hot and cold food items and they also give you a TPR style menu where you can order stuff from the kitchen. Slightly bizarrely there is a (wo)manned bar in the J side but not in the F side, although that is covered by all the staff who get the drinks for you. There is a small 'island' with the buckets containing white wines, prosecco and champagne, which is Laurent Perrier for those who care about these things. I could not agree more - such a pleasant lounge! great views, lovely shower with decent toiletries, the familiar laksa and btw the gin is Hendricks for those who care about these things! "

No toiletries were given except a towel. They had shampoo, bath soap and conditioner in large dispensers. The shower facility was pretty cramp. Level 1 had about 20 sofa seats and about 8 2-seater dining tables. It had quite an extensive choice of self-service liquor. The buffet line wasn't too bad, with mostly Indian and middle-eastern fare, so sashimi and simple sushi. Lots of bread and cheese selection, plus a good fruit counter. There were also a few items on a menu that one can order from including dimsum items (halal of course). Level 2 is a smoking area that contained a similar number of sofa seats, including about 3-4 massage chairs. It also had a buffet with a simpler selection of food and drinks. The lounge isn't great but it isn't too bad either. Sorry, I was too tired to take pics after a very long hot day travelling the ends of Dubai. "

"SIA to spend $20m to build, upgrade airport lounges worldwide",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11892-/page2," Honestly, would love to have more bells and whistles in SKL. But let me add some input from a different angle. I believe SQ also has a lot of homework to do (effort and money to spend) just on improving consistency of their SKLs around the world. For example, why should the SFO SKL be so much more mediocre than others? They do have a nice shower, but they shoot themselves in the foot a bit because despite the shower, they won't even carry tooth brushes, though they did before. You're gonna spend millions on revamping some lounges, but cut costs on toothbrushes from some lounges (and not others)? Does that make sense? So inconsistent! And more importantly, the food and drink offerings and the atmosphere are drab. For its non-SKL lounges too there are some real duds. The Miro lounge at BCN, for example. Really, the offering is quite basic. A few mini sandwiches and some sodas and drinks laid out at a bar. When I was there, it was not kept tidy or refreshed, probably because it was undermanned. Used plates everywhere, empty food platters at the self serve bar. I was traveling in F too, that time, making it seem even more ridiculous. Though even in J (or even maybe Y), why would a basic and dirty lounge be appealing? "

Why would the SKL be the brand that is being optimized? The relevant brands are SQ First Class, SQ Business Class and SQ Economy Class. Your reasoning seems as if it would justify the price premium of SQ First over SQ Business by telling a traveller that his FC experience begins at checkin, gets interrupted at the lounge, and then re-starts at boarding. That would simply be bizarre. (But having a website not be fully functional after more than a year since launch is also bizarre, so I guess anything's possible these days.) "
Very confused SKL lounge dragons.,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/2413-/page1," I am writing this from the SYD SKL F, but it took some work to get into here. I am traveling on UA F and decided to go to the SKL rather than the RCC (easy to understand why...) or the NZ lounge (SKL is quieter, in fact I am the only one in the lounge). When I arrived at the gate, I presented my F boarding pass and my PPS card. The young dragon told me to go in but on the J side. I said I was traveling in F, not J and that I believed I should be granted access to the F side. She opened a folder and only looked at the PPS story. Then as I protested more, she called on the senior dragon who went through the same folder and showed me the new rules for PPS (thanks, but I know them). She then went on to say that everything just changed... (I know that too, except it was about 6 weeks ago) and said ""Do you have a UA gold card?"" I said no, but that I had gold in other *A programs. She asked to see one and I pulled my LH SEN card. She then told the younger dragon to let me in. The novice dragon asked if it was to J or F. The senior dragon said: ""To the F. He's traveling F and has *A gold."" So their new understanding is that a F *A boarding pass is not enough anymore. Well, either they are totally confused or I am. I tend to be a bit cocky and will say they are! Anybody got a reference to what the real rules are now? "
Very confused SKL lounge dragons.,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/2413-/page1," You should definitely have access to the F lounge based on: Lounge Access for International First Class: Customers who present an International First Class boarding pass, regardless of the Star Alliance carrier they fly, have lounge access. They and one guest, are welcome to visit first class lounges or any other members' departure lounges when departing on a Star Alliance flight. Note: AC, BD, OS and SK do not have international first class service. "

Yes it's modern and hipper than the one in T2. What worries me is the lack of space. I was in there last night after 9PM and the place was packed with little or no place to sit. Another troublesome issue IMO is the location. Seems like it would be more reasonable to put it in the middle between the A and B gates rather than at the far end. I'm guessing its location might have more to do with the location of the F Check-In Lounge. Guess I'll have to revisit the SKL T3 one day to re-evaluate. It is nice to see a new lounge, but you would think they would build one that has room to grow. SQ LPP what time are you normally there? Seems rather empty during your stays. SQ LPP what is your take on the shower? At most I thought the water temperature was just luke warm. "

All my pictures of the empty lounge was taken between 1 am to 5:30 am when I decided to stay at the lounge with DeltaFlyingProf. I am sure you can guess.

[KUL] Mini Silver Kris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13459-/page1," In KL again last week, and visited the Silver Kris Lounge in KL. How I ended up there might actually be more interesting than the lounge itself . I was on an MH ticket, but my KUL-SIN sector was a codeshare with Silkair. My business meetings in KL took place the day before. I had a couple of late conference calls in the evening, which meant I had to stay the night, before heading back to SIN the next day. I chose a slothful 11.10am departure from KUL to SIN, which meant that I could wake up at a reasonable hour, then head from the Hilton Kuala Lumpur at KL Sentral to the airport for a quick brekkie before my flight home. A quick ride on the KLIA Express got me to the airport without any fuss. As my MH codeshare ticket was operated my Silkair, I could not check in at the MAS counters at KL Sentral -- I had to head to the Silkair check-in counters at KLIA itself. After picking up my boarding pass, I was on auto-pilot and headed straight into the airside area, to the new dedicated ASEAN immigration counters. This must be one of the greatest features at KLIA! The few times I have been there since this was implemented, the other non-Malaysia queues on arrival and departure were busy, but the ASEAN lanes were free. Thumbs up! But just as I got the queue I realized that I had not yet had breakfast... As I was still in that ""no man's land"" after the departure boarding pass check, and before the immigration counters, I figured I could still go back outside. I headed to the lift (escalators there only go down...) and went up one level back to the landside area. The airport security staffer checking boarding passes was surprised to see me come up the lift, as pax traffic was practically all headed the other way: down the escalator to immigration. ""Can I go outside? I want to eat breakfast before I go in."" ""There is food inside,"" she replied. ""Yes, but I want to eat Roti Canai in the Food Garden.""... She looked confused for a moment, then motioned for me to head out back to the airside departure area... ""Don't they have roti canai in Singapore?"" she must have been thinking... Ironically once I headed to the Food Garden on Level 2, I could not find the roti canai. The stall had either closed in the last 2 weeks, or was now preparing the lunch menu, with other dishes. No roti canai in sight! I went back up to the departure level and headed airside. I would have to eat breakfast in one of the lounges... "
[KUL] Mini Silver Kris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13459-/page1," Back airside, and after breezing through the dedicated ASEAN immigration lanes, I headed to the MAS Golden Lounge. ""Can I go in? I am on an MH codeshare with Silkair, but I am Oneworld Sapphire"". The cheerful lounge attendant looked at my boarding pass, then said, ""Sorry sir, if you were a MAS Enrich member, you could use the lounge, but this codeshare is between MAS and Silkair, and not Oneworld, so you are not able to use the lounge. Very sorry about that, sir."" OK, no worries then. He was totally professional and knew the rules well. I thanked him and headed to the Satellite Terminal via PeopleMover to the Silver Kris Lounge. At the Silver Kris Lounge, I whipped out my Krisflyer Gold Card, and presented my Silkair boarding pass to the staff member at the counter. ""I am on the Silkair flight to SIN, but it is an MH codeshare. Can I use the lounge?"" ""Sure, sir. Please come in. There will be no boarding announcements."" The rules governing check-in and lounge access for code shares are totally arcane, but at least the staff at both MH and SQ lounges knew the rules well and whether or not to let you in... And that is how I found myself in the Silver Kris Lounge in KLIA.... "

There also restrooms in the lounge, although I did not visit them as they were closed during the period I was there. Overall, a comfortable, if unexceptional lounge. A decent pit stop if you need refreshments, or a place to work / surf the internet before the flight, but I would rather spend time shopping in the satellite terminal, or eating at one of the other F&B outlets, than spend a lot of time cooped up in a small lounge.

[MUC] LH First Class Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4234-/page1," I was planning to take pictures of this lounge this week, but it was too crowded. The entrance I used was from H level (Non-Schengen), and I assume there is an entrance from the Schengen level as well (G level). The staff who greeted me were very nice. They explained that the border control will hold my passport during my stay, and I will go through security check before entering the lounge (behind the staff desk). Basically after you enter the entrance door above, to the right is the staff desk. To the left is the border control booth and further down a security with x-ray and metal detector. After that, far left there is a stair down, which is going to the G-level, Schengen area. The lounge is behind the staff desk. Sofas everywhere. To the left, drinks and buffet spreads. There are dining tables, or even the bistro style with high chair small long table while you work on your laptop. If you go straight ahead from behind the desk staff, you will find the usual sofa design placed in a square style. To the left there are 3 or 4 small room to work with computer. Further down, turn left, you will find the rest room, as well as a desk for the shower attendant. The staff who ask for drinks around the lounge at the time I was there were not as friendly and cheerful as in FRA. Different personality, I guess. And looks like they were not enjoying their jobs. And yes, if you are European wearing business suits, will be pampered by the staff. I noticed that others who dress casually, were not asked twice for the drinks. (I know I am an expert in observing things! ) Anyhow, I am sure I just had those not so good crew. I am sure another time will have different experience. Time will tell. I only asked for a glass of champagne. Two kind, but I could not hear what he said. I guess it's not a familiar name to my ears. Yes, there is a cold towel served as well. And for other drinks, I have no idea, since generally I don't drink. I checked the buffet area. There were some sushi and cold meats. Also two kind of hot meals, but I don't know why, somehow it was not as appealing as in FRA FCL. I did not see any menu on the table. Perhaps because I was there between 2pm to 4pm? When I went to the loo, I did not see Etro as the brand of choice. Something else. In short, this is my first time here at MUC FCL. The decor looks so familiar. Yes, a good place to wait for the flight compare to the SEN Lounge I had been to last year. And I don't think there is a view of the tarmac here. Next time, yes, I will be back to this lounge, instead of wondering around the H level terminal which I don't see any interesting shops. "

As for the new airport, may be better to stick to the TG lounge as it is near to Concourse D (where the SQ planes are docked) and it also have its own security checkpoint just after the lounge's exit.

Where exactly is it then, as in which concourse ?. As SQuak says, all the SQ birds dock at the D concourse, which is double handy as it's close to immigration.

Others in D concourse, IIRC, were JAL, Emirates, China Airlines, the extra Cathay lounge, and maybe one or two others. Did any of those close and get converted into the Silver Kris Lounge? EK and CI had the garden view. I walked past practically all of the lounges in Concourse D on level 3 about a week ago, no inkling that an SKL was about to open there. So perhaps it will be someplace else. That could be pretty inconvenient. "

To be honest, after I finished typing my report I left to get on my flight to SIN and it wasn't that far from the ""D Gates"" where SQ flights arrive and leave from. I suppose I was frustrated more than anything else in the first instance, by nobody knowing where the lounge was. I only knew about it when I read the local newspaper in Bangkok on Tuesday. There is absolutely no signage whatsoever. Anyway, enough whining. To those familiar with the main Thai lounge, the best way to describe where the SQ lounge is, is to turn left out of the Thai lounge where the First Class lounge is and turn left again at the next junction. Keep left and wander almost to a dead end and you will see a solitary (""cardboard cut out SQ girl) That's it!! Just down and opposite the new Bangkok Airways Premium lounge. Otherwise, come out of Immigration, turn left, walk for an absolute eternity till you are almost at the end of the terminal building, go down one level using the escalators on the left. From memory, there is a First class lounge at the same facility. Unfortunately, I didn't have time for a snoop. Now I know where it is, I will definitely use it over the Thai lounge. The SQ lounge is much more intimate. The Thai lounge can be an absolute zoo when it is busy. Plus the place is beginning to look a bit tatty. Enjoy "

The 313 square metre SilverKris Lounge has a capacity of 102 seats. It is located on Level 3 Concourse A, after the immigrations area. The Lounge is designed in modern-contemporary style, with walls decorated in rich timber, with full–height fabric-laminated glass panels to enhance privacy. The high ceiling gives a sense of space, while full-length windows allow customers to enjoy tranquil views of the garden outside, as they relax in seats upholstered in nature-touch fabric or rich leather. The SilverKris Lounge is equipped with 50-inch Plasma televisions, a small business area where passengers can catch up on work and a WiFi network for wireless Internet connection anywhere within the Lounge. The Lounge was designed by Leo International Design Group Company Ltd from Bangkok, and construction was managed by Jim & Hall’s (Thailand) Company Ltd. While waiting for their flight, customers can also read the latest newspapers and magazines, and sample a variety of delectable food, ranging from Singapore delicacies, assorted dim sums and sandwiches, a wide choice of sweet pastries, fruits and Haagen Dazs Ice Cream. To complement the food, beverages such as wine, beer, liquor, fresh coconut juice, soft drinks, coffee and tea are served at the Lounge. The SilverKris Lounge is open daily from 0515 to 2300 hours (except on Thursdays from 0515 to 1900 hours). "

I am sure you are right, CarbonMan. But, I don't think cost containment should necessarily mean bad service, food and experience, unless the point is to make TPR so bad that people won't go. You can make delicious food at reasonable cost. In fact, it is one of the things about Singapore that is so amazing -- great food can be had at tremendous bargains whether at hawker stalls or local restaurants. I also don't think good service is necessarily a direct function of cost.

And service that is attentive, courteous, pleasant and fast in service shouldn't be too hard for SQ to pull off on the ground if they can pull it off in the air. I have recently been reminded how much SQ spends in time training and re-training their FS. It is an investment that they have not been able to replicate on the ground which in many places are (am not sure if that's the case in SIN) contracted to third-parties due to costs. Hence there's a marked difference in service quality on the ground and onboard. For us on this side of the fence, we may not realise the trouble SQ goes through to get their FS to the quality we enjoy fairly consistently on every flight. Yes, you're right that cost containment should not necessarily mean bad service, food and experience. Hence their challenge is the proverbial how to do more with less which requires a lot of creative thinking and execution - not easy for some managers. So presumably when the order comes from the top to cut expense by X percent, the easiest thing to do is look at what you can just slash ... from small things like removing flight boards from the lounge (assume that have to pay Changi for it) and delaying refurbishing lounges which is a big ticket item.

I believe the basic training is 15-16 weeks and only 2 weeks of that is safety. And if I am not mistaken, training for other airlines is half as long for the next airline (someone who knows this better than I, please chime in!). All that time training is serious money and truly an investment, as you say. But, shouldn't one expect that having such top in-flight service history, experience, institutional knowledge and culture already in the company mean that it could somehow be easily tapped for uses on the ground?

It makes Krisflyer and BAEC look generous... Before the change to SQ SIN-KUL flights, FC used to be one of the easiest FFPs in the world to get top tier status! As for BAEC, it depends on your circumstances, e.g. * 25,000 BA miles for an upgrade from WT+ to CW from LHR to anywhere in North America is a pretty good deal (plus availability tends to be quite good) particularly when you earn most of it back (even more so with the silver/gold 25/50% bonus). * For those based in the UK, BA's tie up with Tesco (and the Amex 241 vouchers) mean that with some planning it's enough to get enough miles for a trip for two each year to somewhere nice, e.g. I've done NRT (J) and NRT (F) in past years and have CPT (F) coming up next month. Some people in the past earnt enough to do that each year without even stepping foot on a plane! * Eurocheating and (before they were abolished) the BAH-DOH tier point runs etc means that it's pretty easy to get top tier status on BAEC. Of course none of this comes close to just how generous BD are with their programme... "

While KF Gold is nice in that it gets you Star Gold privileges with Star Alliance carriers, I've always felt that SQ have missed out on a big opportunity to increase loyalty (and revenue) by targeting frequent travellers in Y. I think SQ have done reasonably well to maintain loyalty of F and J pax. It is essential for a premium airline like SQ to pamper guests in F and J, and they need to maintain or even increase the exclusivity and benefits of PPS membership to retain (regain?) the loyalty of this segment. But they have long neglected the frequent travellers in Y sandwiched between the top end and the budget conscious, giving them 2nd class frequent flyer benefits, for example, the mediocre KF Gold lounge in Changi, and the fact that if you travel Y, even if you do 150-200K miles a year (Which I do on a fairly regular basis), you will not hit PPS. For that reason, in recent years, as soon as I hit 50K miles and qualify for KF Gold, I essentially stop flying SQ and move across to Oneworld, who treat their economy class frequent flyers much better. That effectively means my annual spend on SQ is between 25 to 30% per year of what it used to be. I am probably not alone in that segment, and with recent corporate cutbacks, I am sure more business travellers are having to travel Y for shorter journeys, or consider alternative airlines with cheaper J options. If I were SQ management, I would refine their loyalty strategy to reflect this, and be more inclusive when it comes to their Y frequent flyers. It's not going to restore my business to SQ to earlier levels, though. I've grown to like Oneworld carriers like QF, BA, JL and CX so much that even if and when I start flying J regularly, I will probably continue flying Oneworld, and not just SQ. "

I signed up to the QF FF programme many years ago, even before Krisflyer was launched. I've not done a detailed comparison of the merits of other OW FF programmes like CX / BA, but I chose the QF programme simply because among the Oneworld carriers, I flew them the most, and over the longest distances. Apart from SQ, they are my airline of choice to ANZ, and to London (If I decide to do a one-stop). Even today, if I choose a one-stop to London, I will try to fly the DXB-LHR sector on QF metal. They have treated me quite well as a frequent flyer (QF Gold / OW Sapphire this year), with the occasional op-up from PEY to J. And even though I fly only Y, I can use their superb lounges in Australia, HKG and elsewhere. The OW lounges that CX, JL and BA have in their respective home bases are very good as well. I've also been upgraded several times on CX and BA. Award and upgrade availability has been ok as well. As an unintended benefit, through the EK tie-up, I get to use the EK lounges too (Although I have never been upgraded on EK). SIN is my home base, and if I had to go with one program, SQ and Krisflyer/Star would be the one. But being a frequent flyer on Qantas/Oneworld has brought me many benefits as well, and I am happy to have had the opportunity to sample what Oneworld has to offer. "

The TG folks will try to steer you towards the SK Lounge; just say no. Turn left when you get to the junction where the path from the T3 shopping area joins the paths to the gates. It will be further down (leftwards) from the SK Lounge. It's one floor above the departure level. If you don't have heavy hand luggage, take the stairs. The elevator is very slow (though charming in its un-modernized way). The hot food tends to be available when the SQ passengers are expected to show up (roughly 3-4 hours before departure). That's OK; the lounge is open outside those hours. The sandwiches and munchies are still better than what can be found in the SK Lounge. For alcoholic drinks, you'll have to order from the staff at the bar. It's no big bother. The staff (reception and bar) are very friendly. Some pics: Pretty good window views (though the views are usually of SK aircraft, not as international a panorama as the views from the VS CH -- but occasionally you'll get a peek of a Golden Goose-decorated tailfin, as in the first picture below ): Munchies bar; wine/G&Ts requestable from the bar located left towards the front of the picture (where you see the bar stools; this area is to the left as you emerge from the stairs): "

In the omission of such information on the SQ website, I'm assuming the answer will be a big fat 'no.' I did read on the Star Alliance website that First Class passengers are entitled to a guest each at Star Alliance First Class lounges, presumably including the operating carrier's own lounges, but I suspect the TPR isn't really a ""Star Alliance lounge"" for the purpose of *A entry policies? I remember bringing in a guest some years ago based on First Class travel but this was the SKL First (back when redemptions cut no mustard with TPR). My partner and I are both flying MEL-SIN-LHR in Suites in 2 weeks and coincidentally, a dear friend and his gf are flying in the opposite direction LHR-SIN-AKL and the transit times happen to tee up, so I thought it'd be a really lovely to treat them to some time in the TPR.

However, customers may experience some delays, including at check-in and baggage reclaim. Customers are advised to check in online and to print their bag tags at the self-service kiosks.

New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page2," Just been told that the new T2 lounge is about a month away from opening. Recommendation at check-in was to use either Air Canada or United's. The former is nice and quiet right now, food looks v bland, but on balance a definite improvement on the old T3 SKL business section. "

I will be in London for a couple of days next week. Hi LHR, The SQ lounge is still being constructed. It was all boarded up when I was there on 7 Nov (Fri). I was given the choice of either the United Lounge, Air Canada Lounge or Plaza Premium Lounge. The Air Canada lounge is near the Satellite Terminal B gates. Some pictures of the AC lounge below. There are also showers in the AC lounge if you want to freshen up before the flight. The SQ lounge under construction appears to be located next to the AC lounge. There is also a Lufthansa Lounge (Star Gold lounge) near the A gates in the main terminal which was not mentioned in the one-pager lounge info sheet by SQ. There is a great restaurant in the T2 airside area, The Perfectionists' Cafe, with dishes by Heston Blumenthal. I would highly recommend eating there before your flight if you are leaving in the afternoon or evening. The pics are from an upcoming TR... "

[IST] TK Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13054-/page1," Okay let me try a sensible contribution As far as the TK IST lounge goes it is definitely still my favourite *G lounge around. Yes, as MAN Flyer mentioned, even after expansion it is still crowded at times, but overall the space and the offerings (food / drinks / amenities) are very good. The catering is Do&Co and pretty tasty. Last time I visited the cakes were actually brought in from Austria from Demel which is one of the top places in Vienna (yes touristy, but still when it comes to pastries. Of course Demel is owned by the same Turkish owner that runs Do&Co. But I digress. The space issue and cleaned out buffets is especially bad around times when loads of flights to the Central Asian Republics depart (9PM onwards) - sorry but that is when I have observed the worst situations. It turns into mayhem and I have never seen a buffet cleaned out in such a short amount of time with people literally carrying plates stacked 10cm high with food. As if they were famished. The Turkish chef making the tasty 'Pide' (kind of a Turkish pizza version) almost lost it when 2 women loaded up food that would have fed 10-12 people normally. Showeres are good, but the few restig rooms on offer are super hard to come by and tied to certain restrictions (IIRC transfer over 4hrs and under 7 or 8hrs). Okay that's it. Enjoy and carry on ... "

It is a great lounge, but ruined by the volume of people in there. I hear you. We were there around lunch time coming in from FCO (got the fancy TK C seat on this A321) and connecting to the TK SIN flight (A330 fully flat) at midnight. Hence we had no queue around that time and plenty of freshly made tasty treats. Had lunch, then coffee / tea and nice cakes. Then we locked our bags in the lockers (good feature) and headed into town (via subway) for a quick spin around some areas we know in IST and had a nice dinner before heading back. Luckily we just got back to the lounge before the mayhem started and had a good seating area plus were on top of the shower list. We were stuffed already and couldn't eat anymore to preserve some space in our tummies as TK inflight meals in C are really good in my book (best C food all around I have had so far). So the impact on us was not that bad, but the scenes playing out weren't that funny if you tried to grab a bite and a bit of rest before the next flight. "

I'm with MANFlyer on this one re: arrivals lounges. I always touchdown into SIN between 6am-7am. Less than 30mins after, I'm sat sipping a mug of coffee in the kitchen of the house just off the upper ECR in Bedok. But, if you really must have a shower at the airport (because of hotel check-in times or not having a crash pad locally), what's to stop you staying airside and using the showers in the lounges in T2 or T3 and clearing immigration after? Arriving into MAN, you can pay a nominal fee to use the showers at the airport Radisson hotel. Ok, It can be argued that if you're in F or J, why should you have to pay a few extra quid. Conversely, if you are in F or J, what's a few extra quid anyway? "

To answer your questions: 1) Yes UA goes from T3. The seperate SQ First Class check-in area at T3 is for SQ only. It does have it's own dedicated immigration channel but it will only take you a matter of minutes to clear immigration in T3 for the UA flights anyway at that time. Changi is a very efficient airport, where queuing is frowned on. 2) Yes you can use the First Class area of the SKL but not TPR as that is indeed for SQ pax only. "

Same for Aeroplan's online partner airlines' system. log in to ANA mileage club => award reservation => Using Star Alliance Member Airlines => key in your travel dates or Click [Flight Search] to search an itinerary up to 12 sectors. Should use this system to check redemption seat availibility rather than keep calling up KrisFlyer membership services, give them your itinerary, than wait for a call back, then tell you which flights no seats. Check with this system first then give them the itinerary. More convenient. SIA's KrisFlyer lose out in this area. Can only check SIA/SilkAir flights. Cannot even tell the seatmap for B777-200/200ER & B777-300/300A. Not so convenient. ANA's straight away tell you the seatmap. Can SIA and KrisFlyer look into implementing this please? "

Good job, SQ! There is a little section for dining as well and several meeting rooms inside. In here now and would agree with this. A big improvement, which granted wasn't hard such was the way they had just let it slide prior to the refurb. Still, I am quick enough to criticise them so fairs fair, this is a very nice place now. Having said that.........., it is a bit disappointing to see the quiet corner at the far side has now gone and even though we still have a manned bar here he goes at 9pm.

In the 45 minutes I have been here they have removed several items and the menu is getting ever smaller. I can only imagine they are switching to an evening menu?!

I seldom go because I try to arrive at the airport late, but was transiting and had an hour to spare. My basis for comparison, not unreasonably I think, are CX HK lounges, BA LHR and QF's Syd/Mel. All have table service for food, all have a wide selection of wines/beers, all have designed by interior designers who have a sense of what frequent travelers are after and a sense of style (although I admit, this is in in the eye of the beholder. in T2 the decor looks like it has been designed by the marketing department. Red vinyl chairs from the 50's, carpet designed to hide the dirt and plenty of low cost marble. Don't they realize people carry PC's. If so, why on earth put power plugs under the faux wood tables? And there are no printers. The food was cold and looked like it came straight from Newton Circus.

"[SGN] Rose Lounge, previously known as the *A Lounge",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4073-/page1," I am in the HCMC Star Alliance lounge now and can advise that the facilities have been drastically cut back. At the old terminal Star Alliance airlines shared with other airlines in a SASCO lounge and it was a bit tight but they had a good range of food and beverage including about 4 hot choices and a proper Vietnamese noodle soup. The bar was self serve and quite extensive. When the new terminal opened Star Alliance was allocated one of the four (I believe) lounges which are all managed by SASCO. Much more space with less customers and a wide choice of F & B. Up to 8 hot dishes plus proper vietnamese soup and an extensive bar. I have not been in the lounge for about 6 weeks and the facilities have now been cut back enormously. Only one hot dish, one cold cut instead of 5 or 6, no baquettes only plastic sliced bread and instant noodles with water not a soup stock. They still have the seafood sauce although the seafood is gone! And the bar has been cut right back - tiger or heineken, only spirit is red label JW and the only white wine I could see was the Da Lat special. There was a guy asking for peanuts and was told that they don't have! I told the staff what I thought of it and there was not much point because they are all SASCO and hide behind 'Star Alliance Management"". When I asked for a business card from the manager they all ran away to hide. Told me to write to SQ. Now I will write to SQ but I will not hold my breath for a response. Any other suggestion on how to bring this travesty to the notice of management? "
"[SGN] Rose Lounge, previously known as the *A Lounge",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4073-/page1," A bit surprised to hear they seem to have cut back. It can't cost much for the food they have in there, and it gets well used. The lounge costs are not just down to SQ as all the *A carriers serving SGN share it ; UA, TG, NH, OZ, SQ, LH.. I was there about 4 weeks ago and they still had a lot of food options, although like the old terminal the hot stuff did have a tendency to get cold due to lying around so I rarely bothered. I am back in a couple of weeks and will see for if it's still the case, if I'm flying *A. Be interested to see if you get a comment from SQ other than 'it's not an SKL etc...' "
"[SGN] Rose Lounge, previously known as the *A Lounge",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4073-/page1, I eventually got to speak to an SQ person at the gate and they told me that the cut-backs were implemented unilaterally by SASCO in all of the lounges in the terminal and that all of the user carriers were receiving complaints. They encouraged me to write as it adds to their argument. It seems that this is part of a campaign by SASCO to increase the user fees. They will probably win since it is not their customers that are complaining. Welcome to the wonderful world of Vietnam where nothing is fixed and everything is negotiable.

Got lounge invitation to 'Common Lounge'. Asked where it was and was told near gate 16. I said, oh near the *A lounge then, and she said it IS the *A lounge. It's no longer called *A lounge, it's now 'Common Lounge'. They must have been up all night coming up with that name.... No idea what has happened here. The fixed *A lounge sign is still on the wall outside but the *A banner listing all the airlines has gone. There is just a KE one now. There are a few A4 sheets with 'Common Lounge' cellotaped to the wall. Wireless in lounge still called *A. I thought a *A lounge here with all the *A carriers operating from here was a good idea. It was well used each time I was in here on SQ or TG. I agree the food options have been drastically scaled down. Asked the desk staff whats happened and got the standard smile and 'Yes'. "

Still run by SASCO and whilst the lounge is OK the F & B is still totally sub-standard. No spirits whatsoever. And the internet connection now sux. The SASCO guy showed me letter where SQ agreed to this level of service for US$23 per pax. SQ staff tell me that they have complained to SASCO and I assume that SASCO are screwing them on price. The most irritating part of the whole deal is the cheesy grin on the SASCO guy's face because he knows that he is screwing up all these foreigners. Near Gate 12 there is now a lounge called the Orchid Lounge. Does this mean that TG have broken ranks and are paying SASCO's higher asking price?

The Orchid Lounge has been there a while and has nothing to do with TG. As Bon says, it's just them being 'creative' with the names. I think that's the one QR and a few others use.

At check-in the choice (as MAN has said elsewhere) is offered of the lounge, a singaporean restaurant or a foot spa. The restaurant aint bad but there is no WiFi and the voucher does not cover what you would eat and drink in an hour. The lounge still has all the F&B cut to the bone. No spirits, instant noodles etc etc - I had to half empty the refrigerator to find a cold Tiger! At least the WiFi works. The SQ staff confirmed that SASCO want a higher price to provide the old level of service and the airlines are not having it. So we have a very fine stand-off. I asked the SASCO staff for the lounge manager's business card and was offered a paper lettergram on which to scrawl my complaints before they put it into the round filing cabinet. Ho hum. "

Can incoming SQ C pax use UA domestic RCC,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5668-/page1," OP here, This is my third year as a UA 1P and each time I barely make the cut. Most of my EQMs are earned on domestic US runs, with the odd international run to Europe or Japan thrown in every year (usually booked in Y though rarely on full Y fares). I travel largely on US federal govt regs, which rarely cover or allow C class or any bookings on non-US carriers. For about a year I was a member of the RCC, until my institution changed their policy about covering the membership cost (I could use miles to renew, but I am stingy!). All this to profess that I would by no means consider myself an expert in Lounges or Air Carriers and have much to learn from excellent groups such as this! As I have mentioned elsewhere, I am considering an assignment with a US firm in KL, so I would hope to increase my mileage accrual beginning this year. Whether it is the TBIT *A lounge or the UA RCCs, all of them have value in allowing one to duck out of the ""madding crowds"" and just get a chance to decompress. I would not call it a luxury, but I would hold it a privilege, as I would guess less than 10% of all air travellers have access to such facilities. To clarify, I would guage the TBIT *A lounge as a distinct cut above most of the US domestic lounges from my (relatively) limited experience and definitely worth a visit if you are eligible, but it's not hard to see, from TRs here for example, that it is easily beat by some other US international lounges and handily by international lounges. cheers all!

New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page5, United is a good lounge. I walked to 2B for an A3 flight to ATH but was worth it. LH is poorer by comparison. Not sure that the SQ lounge looks better than Uniteds. Just more convenient if travelling on SQ. 
New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page5," In here now, and I do like the F side. I have banged on enough about my dislike of windowless/dark lounges, no matter how good the facilities, but this place has huge floor to ceiling windows and is very bright and airy. It does get the sun shining straight in during the afternoon so they have got blinds as well. There are four or five staff serving in here, which was a bit much initially as I was the only one in for a while. There is a number of hot and cold food items and they also give you a TPR style menu where you can order stuff from the kitchen. Slightly bizarrely there is a (wo)manned bar in the J side but not in the F side, although that is covered by all the staff who get the drinks for you. There is a small 'island' with the buckets containing white wines, prosecco and champagne, which is Laurent Perrier for those who care about these things. "

Yes that should be Fast Track, and you'll need your B******s class BP to use it. Once you check in, use the escalators in front of the SQ economy class counters. At the top, turn right and keep right. To your left, there should be a long line (in bad times, stretching past you from the point where you alight from the escalator). That's the economy class line. If you walk towards the departure area, just to the right of the long line will usually be a bored-looking BAA BP checker (usually just one; the economy line has two to three of them). That's the line your BP entitles you to. "

PPS - Access to VS Lounge when flying VS in Y?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12378-/page1," I just returned from my trip to Orlando and as promised I am reporting back on my questions. I am PPS member and flew (AMS -) LGW - MCO - LGW (-AMS) on VS in economy. At the VS transfer desk I in LGW asked whether I would have access to the VS Club House, and the lady at the desk did not know. So I went to the Club House and showed my boarding pass and PPS Club membership card, and was given access without further questions. Very nice and comfortable lounge with good food served at your table and a wide selection of drinks. At (Upper Class) check in at MCO I asked whether I would have access to any lounge. The lady at the desk did not know, but suggested I should check at the Delta Sky Club. I went there, the Delta representative checked her files and said that I had no access. At that very moment a Virgin representative came and I told her I was given access to the LGW Club House without any questions. She made a couple of calls. After the first call she was still in doubt but then after the second she confirmed that I could use the lounge. The Delta lady wrote down my details and I was in. I was very happy about that, especially because my flight was delayed by an hour. The lounge itself is nothing to write home about though: no food, just some snacks, lukewarm white wine and Miller Lite and Budweiser on tap. In summary: PPS members traveling Virgin Atlantic in economy do have access to the Club House in London Gatwick as well as the Delta Sky Club in Orlando, you may need to be a little persistent though.

Hate the late night flights and avoid them whenever I can. The new lounge is good and much better than the old one. They have a good spread of food (hot/cold) and ample drinks etc. There is a couple of plasmas tvs and free wi-fi. There's an office area as well with around 3 to 4 PC's if i remember. Haven't used the showers.. but if rest of bathroom is anything to go by should be nice. Its not the hugest lounge but more than accommodates everyone. THere is some photos i posted a couple of weeks back under the A330 thread.

Its maybe because of space constraints at HKG? But over at CX's Wing, CX has installed both Showers w/Toilets and seperate toilets. And SQ knows of CX's lounges in HKG... in fact, I found TPR very ala Wing First's Library. Except that CX feels much better... with actual books etc. SQ's TPR is all just cosmetic.

I thought I would see what happens so he disappeared for a couple of minutes before returning and saying 'sorry you cannot come in unless you have paid for your ticket'. On another day I may have explained that I have paid for the ticket, but he's a nice bloke and the ludicous decision isn't down to him so I just told him it was a ridiculous restriction and he just shrugged his shoulders and apologised. I told him they will probably get a lot of complaints about it and he said they already had and the situation was being reviewed. I had a quick wander in when he went to check my ticket and while it's nicer than the current 'First' lounge (which granted isn't saying much), it's nothing out of the ordinary, and certainly not deserving of such a stupid restriction.

T3 is really a pain in the ass to walk from the lounge side to the B gates... I don't see the point of TPR at all other than making paid F pax feel more important... Seriously guys, there's no need to cry murder just because SQ is not letting award F pax in... You really are not missing much... Oh yeah, one more thing I forgot to mention, the aircon seems a lot better on the F lounge side...

SIN T2 Lounges Undergoing Renovation,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/10337-/page1," The SilverKris Lounge in Terminal 2 Changi Airport will be renovated from May 2011 The lounge facilities in Terminal 2 Changi Airport will be upgraded from May 2011 to September 2011; and when completed, the SilverKris lounge at Terminal 2 will have new First and Business Class areas. There will be 126 and 246 seats in the First and Business Class area of the SilverKris Lounge respectively. Both sections come with their own dining areas, food service counters, bars, television areas, showers and washrooms as well as nursing rooms. The walls and flooring will be adorned in rich timber and marble. The entire lounge will be WiFi-enabled, allowing you to surf the internet from wherever you are seated. Internet workstations will also be available for use and an extensive range of newspapers and magazines will continue to be on hand. The refurbished Terminal 2 SilverKris Lounge promises to provide an inviting environment for Singapore Airlines Suites, First and Business Class customers as well as PPS Club members to rest or work before boarding their flight. A KrisFlyer Gold lounge will be a new addition, welcoming KrisFlyer Elite Gold members and Star Alliance Gold members traveling on Economy Class who currently use the SATS Premium lounge in Terminal 2. In order to minimise disruption to our members, the SilverKris Lounge will remain operational throughout the renovation period. In order to do so, upgrading works would have to be carried out in phases. In the first phase, the First Class section will be converted into an interim common lounge for PPS Club members and Singapore Airlines customers traveling in the premium cabins, while work is carried out to refurbish the Business Class section and convert part of it into a new KrisFlyer Gold Lounge. The First Class section will be upgraded once renovation works in the Business Class section and new KrisFlyer Gold Lounge is completed, and we will update our members again on the next phase of renovation. We seek your kind understanding and apologise for the inconvenience this may cause. http://www.singaporeair.com/saa/en_U...ws/news_01.jsp "

Another factor on your side is the fact that in the USA there is generally less obsession with lounges being for departures only. If you have Priority Pass, any lounge you can access can be used as an arrivals lounge IIRC. I don't believe there is a requirement of a departing flight, just same day travel (as also required for the AmEx Plat/Centurion lounge program). "

As you say, they don't even seem to have tried with the current SKL F.

Yes, the world have changed. I do agree that SQ did worked harder for their passenger in the past under the old regime. Many of us are frustrated about it liked you about it. I also do not liked the way SQ treated the passengers liked you (when you were short of 3,000 miles to LPPS). Just for my case only, I would have done a mileage run and fly the cheapest economy on SQ or other airlines and it will cost SQ to maintain my LPPS status. Subsequently, I will hope to have greater chances of upgrading while flying EY. Many of us do not liked the changes to PPS but we recognized it and move on. Some liked you changed airlines including BA so SQ has become not relevant to you anymore. Some liked me stayed on and some in between but I have never been too emotional about SQ and I know it is just a purely business relationship. On the other hand SQ biz in EY has been affected by LCCs and they are also in the cost saving mode. I remembered flights to HKG costing a lot more in EY. That has affected the airline mentality. The cut in privileges may actually be an industrial wide trend but I really don't know. I feel that we passengers also need to be sometimes generous particularly when we don't really need it and we bear without it for the majority of the time. I have seen passengers in F Class not accepting vouchers for non-working AVOD. They said it is ok and that they don't really need the AVOD anyway. There are always pluses and minuses. "

When you arrive at the T3 lounge, you will be walked to the entrance of TPR where a second person may check your boarding pass again. They will probably show you to a seat and ask what beverage you would like. You *might* even be offered TPR access if you have another airline's boarding pass printed on SQ FC paper. (This is a mistake, but it has happened to me.) "

Nice interiors - as expected, but not as spectacular as LHR's (from the pictures). I am entering the lounge as an SQ pax today. The BR agent (this is a joint lounge with BR) who greeted me at the front desk, called a VS agent to take care of me. The agent came out and was very courteous and nice. She apologized that they are unable to serve me items for VS menu (she said SQ pax are entitled to that) since the VS service opens only at 4:30 pm. She brought me a BR menu which was quite nice considering BR pax are just up for short hops to TPE. "

Although it is a little bit of a trek up there I definitely think it is worth it. When I first went a couple of years ago I was offered the VS menu no matter that time it was (great Satay) but sometime about a year ago they stopped that and now as you say if you are outside of the VS flight times you get the BR menu (still not bad but not as good as the VS one).

Service is great (on par with onboard) but some staff seems to be shy or maybe with poor english (it's not really a criticism as mine is not stellar ). I was able of course to taste a lot of food and beverages. I was amazed that there were only two red wines : one californian cabernet sauvignon and one italian chianti classico. The Singapore Sling was less less good than onboard : it look likes a one liter coke served in the US (more than half the glass was full of ice cubes). And my major deception was after tasting the Burger Foie Gras (the SQTalk Special of course ! with a little more Foie Gras ) The burger is raw inside and overcooked outside The foie gras was completly tasteless, close to a ""surimi"" of foie gras. The only sauce provided was ketchup, but I can't imagine eating foie gras with ketchup. At least they were more creative at First Class Terminal in FRA, they were offering a ginger ketchup. I've tasted Egg Benedict, Singapore French Toast, Green Peas Soup, Lobster. All were disappointing. The little buffet was much less offering than the one in FCL but with the same entrees. No dessert except ice creams. Ultimately a very disappointing experience but maybe I was expecting too much as SQ give us so much pleasure in the air. "

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page22," Lots of questions.... I just read through all the pages of this forum and it seems like at some point the policy for ""TPR"" DID change? So just to be clear...if I have a first class award ticket, ""O Fare Ticket"", than I WILL be granted access to ""The Private Room""??? If not than I will still be able to access the normal ""First Class"" section of the SKL in T3? Is the food that different? Originally posted by Kyo View Post You're outta luck my friend. Unless you *ahem*... come in the night before... as someone once did... wonder who... O.K. so this is an interesting statement and I was actually debating doing this...will explain below...but here is my question: If I am on the 9:30 am SIN->NRT->LAX flight, can I arrive the NIGHT BEFORE, check in...get into SKL F (or better yet TPR)...eat dinner... ..then go wander Changi, and come BACK in the morning for breakfast and a shower before my flight leaves? Assuming I get into ""TPR"" do they take and keep my invite card? From the Singapore Airlines website it says that check-in for ALL SQ flights at SIN starts 48 hours before departure... Now I know MOST people would think I am crazy for wanting to do this... *BUT*...I LOVE airports and this is my very first time visiting Changi and I really want to see all of it...even if it is late at night when it is empty. If there is any group of people who understand such weird behavior...I hope it is y'all... "
[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page22," Burj, As long as you hold a SQ First Class Boarding Pass, now you can enter the TPR. Once you enter the TPR, the invitation card will be taken away from you, so I believe you can only go in once. Need other frequent flyers here to confirm. If you can go in only once, suggest you come in the night before to enjoy dinner in the TPR (you can check in your luggage the night before as well), the TPR will close around 2am after the last flight departs, thereafter, the First Class Silver Kris lounge will still be open (they are open 24 hours), you can either have your rest there or you might want to stay at the transit hotel airside (in transit area). However, you need to make advance booking first as transit hotel is pretty popular. Advance booking meaning you do not pay first but reserve online first. I would like to add that you can keep entering/exiting the First Class Silver Kris lounge as long as you hold a departing SQ First Class Boarding Pass. I understand you are excited and loved visiting airports, and Changi is a must to visit if you have not done so, lots of greenery inside for your information..enjoy your flight! "

Welcome to SQTalk, Burj. As feb01mel said, you can check in and obtain your BP the night before, and it's that BP that secures lounge access. You're right in noting that the access policy has changed, so AFAIK an SQ F BP is all the credential that you'll need. Happy exploring at Changi. "

So if a F class boarding pass is all I need to get into ""TPR"" would it be a problem entering more than once? Maybe when I leave at night I can tell them I'll be back in the morning and ask for my invite card back? I don't want to get OT, so is there a forum specific to Changi questions? Like what is open at night? Gardens, etc? Ideally I'm thinking of arriving at Changi around 11 pm to midnight, check in at the exclusive First Class check in at T3, go to ""TPR"" and have dinner...and then walk around Changi, maybe taking a nap at the T2 SKL, coming back to T3 SKL and (maybe?) getting back into ""TPR"" for breakfast, if not the normal SKL F area is fine...shower and then catch my 9:30 am departure. Also a little OT...is there a thread/forum where people can say which flights they will be on, or when they will be at Changi and see if they can meet up? I am a regular poster on FlyerTalk and the Delta forum has such a thing...we also have these big yellow FlyerTalk tags to put on our bags...like being in a secret society... "

Our legal department worries about declaring revenues and other such technicalities; our beancounters worry about the costs; and getting volunteers to serve as our distribution centers is a bit tricky.

Yes it's a nice place and I do understand why those who don't go there often may want to try the place for themselves, but it's not that good that it is worth of this messing around, seriously. It's a pleasant place with a very limited menu of distinctly average food but it's definitely not somewhere you want to spend hours and hours in or go to so much trouble to go more than once.

I have just got here and the place is dead, staff wise not pax, which there would not be many of mid afternoon on a Saturday. Staff wise, where before you would have 3, 4 or 5 staff greeting you as you walked in, today I was escorted in at the far end by one staff member, and the only other staff in the entire place are two behind the bar. None whatsoever in the main area. I walked down to the food area and back and did not see a single member of staff. I had to go to the bar to order food. Previously if you moved in your seat they were over like a shot. They have also now closed off the entrance next to the J lounge and now only have the one at the far end towards the SKL.

Any assistance would be appreciated! Regards- KB First of all, Welcome To SQTalk! That should be such a long journey. Presumably it is no stop over in between. But since you are in F, you should be well rested. At JFK, F pax on SQ25 will be invited to use VS Clubhouse. I like this lounge. Fun and funky. And yes, love my time waiting there. If you are interested, you can check the previous menus for SQ25. Arriving in FRA, depending on that day, whether SQ25 gets a gate, or has to park in remote, all pax must disembarks. You can ask the ground staff where you can go for shower or which lounge to go to. As I recalled in May, it was UA RCC, but I decided to go to LH SEN Lounge instead. SQ25 usually arrives in T3 at Changi,a nd your flight to SYD will depart from T3 as well. SKL T3 First Class Lounge would be the choice. Since it's a redemption F seat you have, at the moment, the policy doesn't entitle you to enter The Private Room. If you have a long layover at Changi or have a stopover in Singapore, you can use The First Class Check-In Lounge which will let you to go through special immigration area and you will be in the departure secure area in a matter of minutes. In SYD, SQ has its own SKL FCL, but some of us here like the Air New Zealand Lounge instead. Of course by now you know where to go at Changi. It's before midnight flight for SQ26. So the lounge is busier than usual. Arrival of SQ26 in FRA is very early morning. Usually it will be at Gate C8 or somewhere near that. The lounge nearby would be UA RCC/IFL. I usually opt for shower here. Yes, the H2O amenity kits provided in the shower room is a pretty good for me. The shower will make me refresh for the morning day flight back to JFK. Hope this is helpful. Have great flights aboard Singapore Airlines. "

And back. And no, am not there to see idols, unless TPR is an idol location. lol. And also, I am indeed allowed 48 hours to check in, and the lounge is also available, so I am technically not breaking any rules and I am also flying off for sure. If someone is in the transit area and forgot to bring something, and he still has time to go back to his hotel/home to retrieve it and catch the flight, i think it will be ok reason too. But I will probably not proceed, as I can understand the apprehension if I exit and came back with another piece of check-in luggage, given that I did not come in from another country in the past 48 hrs. However, I do wonder if I am overseas, and is back in SIN for a ""stopover"" of 48 hours (transit is really under 24 hours), what happens if I really need to add another luggage after I already collected my boarding pass (to have a meal in TPR first)? I believe since I have the right to (assuming that I am leaving in SQ FIRST next), I probably should consider making full use of the TPR.

So if you arrive into SIN on a transit, use the lounge before entering SIN, go into the city and then come back airside to use the lounge again, no-one will say anything. However, if you are leaving from SIN (i.e. starting from landside), enter airside to use the lounge, come back out landside and then want to go back airside to actually depart, that's the scenario we're talking about. CIQ at airports is not to be taken lightly, and certainly not to be treated like an MRT ticket gate. Regardless of whether for idols or the lounge, if you plan on going home then you would not be intending to fly when you're entering airside on the previous day. You could come up with any number of excuses when pulled up by immnigration such as forgetting something at home etc, but ultimately you cannot be certain that the immigration will believe you. Is it really worth the risk (however small) and potential hassle? "
[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page34," IIRC, the immigration officers are more lenient towards Singapore passports holders who enter and exit the secure area more than once in a day. BUT they will still ask for you for a reason. "

Lol. Actually, there are many plausible and valid reasons. Just whether if it is worth the hassle. 48 hours in transit area is a long time, and there could be last min things that may crop up, which is why I was wondering how do people who reported they entered and exit TPR did it, and what happens to their check-in luggage (there may be changes but what happens if there is something I forgot to check in if I check-in the baggage so early ). Personally, I would think it is too much of a hassle to do it leaving SIN, but if someone is arriving from overseas in departing in 48 hrs, I think may be something to think about - and of course, prepared for some talking to and frowns, if one intends to go ahead. [I know some based in SIN even collect the SQ transit vouchers and go home and back. And if its non-SIN based, on 48hrs stopover, I can imagine them being too bored in transit & TPR after 24hrs and decides to go out and come back again. They probably need to explain themselves to CIQ though.] On another note, is Dom 2003 the new default in TPR? "

Cheers Clowesy No need to clear immigration but you would need to clear ""transit security"". After clearing security, take the internal airport train (people mover) towards ""Gate 33-80"", and you will be right where the VSCH is. However, you will have to walk back to your SQ gate, and it could be a slightly long hike depending where the SQ plane is assigned to. With 4 hours, and since you have only been to SKL, I would suggest you do a lounge hop on the 4 lounges which a KFEG has access to in HKG, namely VS, TG, UA and SQ (assuming you have the enthusiasm). For me, both VS and TG rank highly for me in terms of ambience and food selection. And more often than not and if time permits, I will skip SKL and go straight to either VS or TG lounge whenever I am in HKG. "

The burger was fine but nothing special. Perhaps the Chinese food in the SKL J would have been a better choice. We do like the extensive tea choice though. Maybe we're getting old but the atmosphere (too dark; like a car park) and music got on our nerves. We've taken refuge in the relatively bright and quiet business centre. The staff are certainly much friendlier than (say) a BA LHR lounge but on the whole (and without trying any of the treatments available), we think we prefer the T5 BA CCR (which feels more spacious and classy IMVHO from our one visit there). phaleesy will no doubt chime in later with any further thoughts.

Furthermore, after taking some photos, phaleesy thinks the VS CH in the photos really looks very photogenic even though the initial feel when we sat there wasn't so. And the staff really are very friendly. We're still not impressed with the VS CH food though.

Catering - the menu is quite impressive but the food I got was not so. This will become more apparent when I post the pictures soon. 2. Service - very good, especially in the Brasserie. 3. Atmosphere - I managed to tune out the music out of my head so that wasn't as much of a problem for me. The lounge overall is very photogenic, I must say. 4. Etc - the 10 minute neck/shoulder massage was great, the Office was good to work in, the ability to check your coat and bags was a nice touch, and unfortunately the Garden (for a bit of planespotting ) was sadly closed due to some inconsiderate smokers. By far the best lounge in T3 LHR, I'm sure - but I think the food let it down for me. "

Opening of new Ahmedabad Airport,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6832-/page1, SQ provides one of the best services in the World despite dealing with the conditions of the some of the airports it flyies into. A number of us fly regularly from various cities in Australia to Ahmedabad. Is anyone aware when the new International Airport is likely to open? The current lounge at Ahmedabad reflects the age of the airport. On most occassions a Pax is luckly just to be served tea at the current Ahemedabad lounge. Can anyone tell me what arrangement SQ has in place for its lounge at the new Ahmedabad Interanational Airport when it is opened? 
Opening of new Ahmedabad Airport,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6832-/page1," I didn't know that there will be a new AMD. But is SQ even considering to have its own lounge at AMD? It doesn't even have its own lounge in other destinations in India e.g. BOM (Star Alliance) or DEL (general), or even in DXB or EWR/JFK. Most likely it would use whatever is the standard airport lounge in a new AMD. Another possibility might be to use AI's lounge in AMD (if any)when AI becomes a Star Alliance member, assuming that AI designates such a lounge in AMD as a Star Alliance Gold lounge. Furthermore, since SQ didn't acquire lounge facilities in the present AMD and the AMD route has been operating for some time now, perhaps they saw/will see no need to? "

[BOM] LH Star Alliance Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6534-/page1," Lounge is Lufthansa Lounge - to the right, the business class section, to the left, the first class section. Both are overcrowded for its size with the food quality getting worse and worse. Very crowded by ANA, CO, and SQ425 pax around 9-10 pm, and then LH, LX, TG, OS, SQ423 not long after that. Much nicer and peaceful in the morning. The duty free area is a lot better now compared to 4 years back. There is food court with quite some variety of selection including fast food : pizzas, KFC, etc. Still chaotic at exit immigration and security during peak hours. About 30-45 minutes from check-in counter to lounge is typical at 9pm. Entry immigration is relatively a breeze (no more than 5 min queue) although the walk from the plane is very long. "

It's v dreadful waiting for 423. 9pm sharp seems to be the sweet spot where they open more counters and security checkpointS. Try to check in around 845 or so. Any earlier, only a few counters are open and the queue though not that long is slow moving. "

SQ Lounge in AMS,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11146-/page1," Should have noticed by now that SQ is progressively closing their own lounges in their destinations as a cost cutting measure. It's known as ""outsourcing"". To keep and maintain your own lounge is great for customers as they need to have the standard that SQ has so often boated about!! We can be ""pampered"" but it comes at a great cost. Fobbing us to another carrier's lounge is cheaper as they pay accordingly to the number of paxs that uses their facilities (fixed cost). And if PPS complain about the facilities, SQ can simply say they have provided us with lounge facilities and there is nothing they can do about it as they do not operate the lounges. Isn't this a sign that the sun is fast setting on SQ? Carriers that are progressive and on the up will create their own lounges to create a ""seamless"" expression of service both in the air and on land!! "
SQ Lounge in AMS,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11146-/page1," Unfortunately, the AMS is indeed gone, and has been replaced by the (new) Menzies lounge, which is where the old KLM RoyalWing lounge used to be. I was there yesterday, and the entrance to the lounge was clogged by a horde of people asking guest access, and they also had a sign up with walk-in prices for food and showers. Things took a turn for the better later, as I saw one of the SQ staff standing off to the right after the reception, next to a Singapore Airlines sign. The right-hand corner of the lounge is reserved for SQ passengers only complete with food and drinks. These are the same as elsewhere in the lounge, but at least the SQ area feels a bit more private and quiet than the rest of the lounge. I spoke to the lady representing SQ (a familiar face at least!) and she explained the the SilverKris lounge had not been renovated in over 20 years, the carpets were worn thin, internet was intermittent, and that it was generally in need of a refurbishment. With only one daily flight now (remember the AMS-EWR flights?) and no First class, SQ management decided not to renovate but to use a third-party lounge. I really do miss the SilverKris lounge, having spent so much time there over the years. I was happy to put up with the lack of renovations, I liked the SQ amenities and the peacefulness, the mints and chocolates. The new lounge is indeed brand new (the old Menzies lounge has been closed), the food and drink selection is OK but not spectacular. It is better than the old Menzies lounge. And the SQ-only area makes it feel a bit less forbidding after the SKL... Anyway, I overheard a number of passengers expressing sorrow at the closure of the old lounge to the lady from SQ, but I guess the SKL is not coming back. "

SQ Lounge in AMS,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11146-/page1," For those who missed the old lounge and have yet to visit the contracted Menzies' lounge, here is a quick intro: An invite to the Menzies Lounge is offered at check-in. After you clear immigration (yes, there is fast-track but still quite a bit of a queue), you turn right and will see the sign as in the pic below. At this point, you'd need to remember that it is lounge #42 but the name ""Menzies"" will pop up later on. Much, later. Go up the escalator and walk, walk, walk.... There was no crowd at the counter when I arrived (whew!). Anway, the lady noticed my SQ BP and immediately pointed me to the SQ side, taking my invite from me as I went by and carefully made record of my visit. I am guessing SQ pays them per visitor (?). The lounge is not big but adequate. There are high and low backed leather chairs in the lounge area: The dining side looks like a cafetaria and was empty. If you look beyond the glass partition in the pic below, you'd see that the non-SQ side has quite a crowd. Food and drink selection are quite good for the single SQ late morning departure each day. There are nice pastries, bread (still warm under the cloth), decent coffee, good tea selection and a small range of non-premium alcoholic drinks for those who'd lke to start early. WiFi is free for SQ passengers. You'd need to collect a pre-paid ticket from the reception. Toilet facilities are in the other side. Basic but Ok, I guess. I am not sure if there are shower facilities, though. My verdict - not luxurious but pretty decent. I'd rate it way above FRA and maybe just a wee bit better than CPG. "

To get there you have to go up a lift then on a hell of a walk, most of it outside but covered, the path of which is across part of the Panorama Viewing Deck. It may be a trek, for now with all the work going on at Schiphol, but it's a very nice lounge so worth it. The reason I post this here is while I was there I saw the 'This section is for SQ pax only' sign, which would indicate it is now SQ's lounge. However, the website still names the Menzies lounge as their lounge at AMS. This new one is now 'Lounge 41' IIRC. I did see that MH also seem to use it. "

SQ Lounge in AMS,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11146-/page1," Just to update this for anyone who may be flying SQ out of Schiphol. The long walk stopped a few months back as they opened up the new central security area and you could get directly to the lounge (and the BA one next to it) from the terminal area underneath. Unfortunately the next stage of the upgrade works is underway and that route is closed off again. The walk isn't as far as before but it's worth bearing in mind if you're running tight on time, especially as SQ usually seem to be at gate G3 and those around there. "
SQ Lounge in AMS,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11146-/page1," Thanks for the update, that was one heck of a long walk indeed... had three crew rushing me along at different stages of the journey "
SQ Lounge in AMS,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11146-/page1," Fortunately it's not as bad as it was when they originally opened the lounge, that was a squelchy walk in a downpour. And according to the dragons the lifts outside the lounge straight down to the terminal area underneath should be up and running before the end of the year. "

OTOH, the non-TPR F section doesn't have any couches of the sort. Can't speak about the TPR...yet. When you enter, they'll usually ask you if you want a wake up ""call"". They'll usually provide you with a blanket and the big pillow as well. And yes...the experience is worth it. You'll feel like you have the entire place to yourself.

And no...I didn't have the guts to lay out on the floor. They'd probably kick me out and I'd find myself in the koi pond. Now I think of it, there is the bench in the buffet area. Not sure how they'd react to that either. Originally posted by MAN Flyer View Post They close part of the lounge during quiet periods in the day time as well now, and still do it in the Raffles side at T2. Yup. They vacuumed the area. Nice part is that they were quiet and didn't bother. Originally posted by Kyo View Post They unscrewed a lightbulb in TPR to dim the light? Or is this in SKL F T3? Very odd... This was in the T3 SKL F. I thought I was delusional, but it really happened. The guy did a quarter turn to turn the light off. I forgot to check and see if there is a switch.

I got off a flight from LHR and went to the Swiss Lounge near gate B22 (was about 8pm). Was told that the lounge closes at 8:30pm and I told the LD that I will just pop in for a quick coffee and then head over to the lounge in the Schengen area. The LD then informed me that if I did enter the first lounge, I would not get access (I am KF*G, no PPS) to another lounge. Seems that KF only will pay for one entrance for it's *G members at ZRH (not for those in J or F, or TPP/QPP/LPP). He would not give me a print out but allowed me to look at the computer screen and I can confirm that this is true. Was also told that KF is one of the very few *A members who do this. It is bl**dy annoying IMHO as all the Swiss SEN/Business lounges are considered *G lounges and I have never encountered this problem in other airports (LHR T1 where you can use the *A lounge as well as the BD lounge, BNE where you can use the Koru Club as well as the SKL, etc.).

As MAN Flyer mentions, it's a real trek to get to either of the LH lounges from the UCC, including a security check where they were patting down every single pax! Queues were getting really bad as the morning progressed Added to that, as MAN Flyer again points out, SQ26 leaves from that end of the airport, so I would see no reason to use the LH lounges at all. From what I saw of the Business side of the RCC, I reckon it looked more pleasant and comfortable than either of the LH lounges; the First side was certainly more inviting. nickbot "

If there were more security staff on duty it would make the process far more painless.

It takes only 3 mins (maybe less) to get from T2 to T3 and I think from memory every 15 or 20 mins using the train.

Everything from OZ F lounge in the main terminal to the C lounge in the satellite are consistently underwhelming, with almost every aspect of the lounge well behind most of its competition. KE is a little better, but still far from competitive. One of the problems is that they allow too many people into the lounges through Priority Pass and Korean credit cards.

[ICN] Asiana Business Class Lounge in Satellite Terminal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13114-/page1," Originally posted by stargold View Post It seems that Koreans (yes, both KE and OZ) just can't do decent lounges. Everything from OZ F lounge in the main terminal to the C lounge in the satellite are consistently underwhelming, with almost every aspect of the lounge well behind most of its competition. KE is a little better, but still far from competitive. One of the problems is that they allow too many people into the lounges through Priority Pass and Korean credit cards. It basically makes the provision of decent F&B prohibitively expensive, especially given the speed at which entire servings of hot food can disappear literally in minutes. Recently, I have started skipping ICN lounges altogether. The only exception is when/if I gain access to the KE F lounge, where I will get one of those gold/silver metallic bag tags made. Of the KE J lounges at ICN, I find the one in the main terminal to be much better even though it's obviously older. "

I am bloody disgusted in Singapore Airlines actually, what other airline on earth does this at their major hub? I do not know of any. In fact SQ can go and get stuffed, I simply won't use them for long haul connections through SIN in Y in future. Cathay will let me into the F lounge in HKG as oneworld Emerald, and Qantas will allow me the same in SYD and MEL flying Y where I can not only have a shower but I can also grab a facial for earning top tier status. Thai have showers in the *Gold lounges and they are quite nice too. I am assuming Malaysia offer the same? I will use them once they join oneworld instead of SQ. SQ has almost lost me completely, Thai is now superior in almost every respect in economy class. well to me is that they do not ""value"" much on the Y pax. That's why I posted before asking if not so ""infrequent"" F/C really worth much more than very ""frequent"" Y customer? I think for SQ the answer is yes. "

I guess in SQ's mind - whoever is using them from outstations and connects via SIN is not important and thinking is that people starting at the hub don't need showers. Sometimes the dullness of SQ management decisions really baffles me - I always took them for a smart crowd. A shame and a disappointment. Well same with demue. I never took shower in any lounge and do not think will need one. But again, lounge is expected to have shower and toilet!! But again this phenomena is not a new one.

Same thing when I fly from IAH which takes off at 1700; thankfully Continental has the wisdom to install showers. However, the one disappointing lounge for me is the one at EWR which is run by SAS. Flight takes off at 2300 and they don't have any shower facilities! SQ must really look into filling this gap. SQ must have done some sums and decided that there's insufficient non-SIN based *G pax to warrant shower facilities (presumably the SIN-base ones can do it at home). But for long-haul pax like myself, having a hot shower at the end of a long work day before a longer flight is not only stress-relieving but helpful to fellow pax when I pull off my shoes. "

As a 'elite gold' member one would expect to be treated with a little more respect and you certainly do get that with other airlines at their main hub. As for the TG lounge in SIN, I wouldn't expect a shower there as the only destination is BKK and it is merely 2 hours away so one could grab a shower during the transit in BKK. It is not a TG hub so doesn't matter. Flying QF in Y as a Qantas Gold or Platinum I can shower in any of the Australia-Europe connection points: SIN, BKK and HKG. Why can't SQ offer that? "

Originally posted by young View Post Hmm i will be flying out on TG F the following morning after arriving on TG JCL the night before. Will i be granted access to the F lounge for a wash up on arrival at BKK? As with everything with TG, that can depend on a number of things like does the person you meet/ask know the rules and if so what mood are they in and can they be bothered sticking to them. Flying out in F allows you access, but they will be expecting to escort you through immigration. However, I have to say presuming you have a hotel room for your overnight stay and unless you have a meeting to go to immediately why do you want to go to the lounge when you can head to your hotel and/or get out into one of the world's greatest cities ?. You have access before your flight the next day anyway, so if you are that concerned about trying out the lounge (and it's not that good that you should go out of your way) just get there earlier. I have always been of the impression that if someone is doing a flight they are really looking forward to or don't take very often - like an award in First/Business Class - then you should try and make your trip as easy and relaxed as possible so you can enjoy it. There is another thread on the TG board where the OP is prepared to spend the night hanging around in BKK with nowhere to go prior to flying First Class, rather than heading into the city, which to me seems to defeat the object of flying in First: http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/thai-...cting-bkk.html "

[SIN T2+T3] Questions regarding showers at SKL,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15330-/page1," Hello SQTalk! First time posters from Germany here... Our upcoming honeymoon will take us to Singapore and Brisbane. We also chose Business Class for the first time, and as far as we understand, this will grant us access to the SilverKris lounges for the two departures from SIN (SQ to BNE, I guess from T3; and on LH back to MUC, probably T2). Since both flights will depart from Changi in the evening (21:15, 23:55), it would be a great benefit if we could take a shower prior to the flights. Well... first time lounge visitors as well... We have a couple of questions regarding the showers: Do we have to make a reservation for a time slot in advance, or do we just show up at the front desk and ask for access to the shower rooms? Is the access time-restricted, like, 15 mins per guest etc.? How early should we arrive to allow for waiting times for the showers in the evening? Can we - at least with some certainty - plan that we will indeed get the opportunity to take a shower, or would we have to hope for good luck to secure a time slot? Are soap/shampoo, towels and a hairdryer provided, or do we need to bring our own? Thank you for your insights and tips! Mr and soon-to-be-Mrs nabla "

Overnighting in Zurich,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6130-/page1," I don't think the LX lounge is an option because I believe they close overnight. There are a bunch of hotels in nearby Oerlikon which are served by shuttle buses -- Hilton tends to be pricey but if you can get a room on points, it's quite good and very convenient. The only other hotel near the airport I've stayed in is the Moevenpick, which I preferred due to the more spacious feel. (This assessment doesn't consider the nice upgrades to the Executive Floor that they grant you at the Hilton if you're HH Gold. The staff member in the lounge often remembered me and would occasionally hand me a small carafe of red wine to take to my room ""so you can sleep well tonight after a long day"". ) "

TPR Access for Proposal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14969-/page1," Hi, next month I'm travelling through Singapore flying J with SQ and TK with my girlfriend. I plan to propose marriage in Singapore airport (for several reasons I won't go in to here). It would be a lovely touch if the rules could be broken and we could have a few minutes in the TPR for the proposal and a glass of champagne there. Are there any thoughts on if this might be possible and how to try to make it happen? Many thanks in advance. "
TPR Access for Proposal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14969-/page1," TPR is reserved for F pax. When I was Kirsflyer Solitaire and flying J, I could access the F lounge but not the TPR. If you have a good status with SQ, I would suggest that you call (email may be better) in to make a request. It would help if you're flying from SIN on SQ (not arriving on SQ). For the moment, I can't think of an alternate location within the airport where you can do your proposal unless you don't mind the flying public potentially joining in. All the very best to getting access to TPR and also to your marriage proposal, and most importantly your married life together in the coming years. "
TPR Access for Proposal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14969-/page1," Asking SQ to break rules... You've set yourself quite a challenge there! All I can offer is strongly agreeing with CarbonMan's suggestion about which flight is SQ and which is TK. If your itinerary is SQ from SYD-SIN (I'm assuming SYD from your name), then flying out of SIN on TK, then on the return, flying TK into SIN and SQ back to SYD, then your best chance is on the return leg. Lounge access is always based on the departing flight and airline. Good luck with your mission! The worst that can happen is that they reply with a polite no, or perhaps offer some kind of alternative offer. "
TPR Access for Proposal,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14969-/page1," Might be a good publicity for them, but it might end up being a double edged sword as it will set a precedent. But good luck giving a shot and congrats! "

Interesting approach. You can reach out to JetQuay - they offer you an exclusive setting plus they will drive you in buggies. Better than SQ and you don’t need to ask for any exceptional treatment.

[ORD]  Swiss Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3166-/page1," Located at Terminal 5, right after the security check. Two sections: To the left is for First Class and HON. To the right is for Business, Senator and *G. There is a room for working and also a smoking room (if I am not mistaken). The biggest problem is the fact that business class pax can just move to the first class section. The men's rest room is in the F area. And between both lounge, there is the kitchen or prep room where the guests just go through that room from the C area to the F area. Yes, the C was packed. No hot food. And definitely the food is inferior than the UA F Lounge at T1 or even the AA one. From my experience, if you start your journey from ORD, taking LX would be fine. Yes, from the city go straight to T5. But, if you are connecting from another city, better off taking UA or LH. Yes, I was taking UA from YVR and thus more convenient if I just transfer to another UA flights or LH flights which depart from T1 as well. It is a hassle to go from T1 to T5. Taking a train and having to manuver lots of obstacles. Thus, a very long connecting time is needed. "

As others have said, it's really tucked away. It's like a speakeasy, hidden in the back of the FC SKL. The entrance is cool. This large, frosted glass wall of a door lifts open (up or to the side..can't remember) to reveal the room. We were reminded that this was a new facility. We sat down for some breakfast. I ordered the Belgium waffles, and Mrs. Getonline ordered eggs and sausage. The food was ok, nothing spectacular. What was odd, and made us uncomfortable, was how we had one or two servers hanging on our every word and action. I like to be left alone to eat, and not have someone standing nearby, ready to pick up a fork or napkin should I drop one. Perhaps the extrememly wealthy (who can afford to regularly buy first class airfares) are accustomed to this service/treatment. It was too much. Sure, the lounge was nice, but honestly, our favorite lounge on our entire three week trip (transiting Frankfurt, Singapore, SFO and ICN, and visiting Vegas, Bali, Maldives and Napa) was the SKL in T2. It was clean, showers were available on demand (no lines like in that hellhole *A SEN lounge in FRA), and I could plug in and use my laptop wirelessly.

At Check in, staff provide you with an invitation card, golden color. Once you arrive in the First class lounge, you are taken directly to the TPR room. You are then handed over to TPR staff which take you to a seat and offer you drinks/ menu, etc...I tried to keep the invitation card as to scan it here, however, they would not let me keep it. Although I insisted that this was only a piece of paper and that it could not be re-used another time since the date was on it, they advised it was policy to keep it.. Guess its to avoid passing it to someone else. Quite disappointing. Once In the TPR, had some drinks quietly and there was an italian passenger screaming in his phone for a while. Many people were complaining and asked the staff to speak to the loud/upset customer. But it appears as non went, to afraid to disturb the angry man.. So experience was just alright. No Dom or Krug in the TPR only Heidseck. The rest of the flight to CDG was ok, bumpy, full, but good service.

Bringing a guest into JFK VS Clubhouse,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8617-/page1, I have recently redeemeed an award ticket for First Class travelling JFK to FRA on SQ. I understand that SQ has a contract arragement permitting F ticket holders to use the VS Clubhouse at JFK. What I would like to know is whether I will be able to bring a guest with me into the VS Clubhouse? My guest will be taking a domestic flight on the same evening and it would be great if we could use the VS Clubhouse together. The issues I see are: a) my guest is not flying SQ that day; b) my guest is taking a domestic flight to Denver. Do you need to clear immigration and security in order to access the club lounge? Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Any update on either lounge (or any other I've missed) since the last post was two years ago? Thanks in advance! We tried 3 *A lounges prior to departing on SQ238 earlier this month. Of the 3, NZ is still my favourite of the lot. 1) SKL - hasn't changed. still small, cramped with rather glaring lights. Never mind the lack of natural lighting or tarmac views, but they have some sort of fittings on the few windows they had in the lounge. It's been a while since I've used the showers here but from the last time I used them, I recall that they had some decent showers. OK selection of F&B. Also, whilst it didn't affect me, the other half had a headache from some sort of scent or pollen emitted by plant/s installed in the SKL. 2) UA RCC - much airier than the SKL with more natural lighting. We were only in there for a little while (to bide our time whilst waiting for the NZ lounge to open) so didn't check out the food/drink selection, but it looked as though the SKL had a better drinks' selection. lounge staff here were v welcoming and even made sure that we knew where/when the SQ flight was departing. 3) NZ - we were the only people in there as the next NZ departure was a fair while away. it does get crowded during NZ departures and especially in the late arvo when TG pax arrive (but so does the SKL prior to SQ flights). lots of natural lighting, tarmac views, and the best selection of F&B. very soothing decor and comfy furniture - refer to the pics as the lounge hasn't changed much. the lounge dragon let us in without a fight this time, but wasn't v nice in doing so.

[CPT] SAA Baobab Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11184-/page1," SQ J pax have a choice of either the BA Galleries Lounge closer to security or the SAA Lounge at the far end of the international concourse. I took a quick look around the former which had a very limited snack selection around 10.30am and decided to head to the latter instead. The Baobab side of the lounge was almost empty prior to the departure of SQ479, perhaps most pax plonk for the BA lounge, also SAA has few international flights out of CPT. It's an OK place for a short stop, with plenty of natural light but limited tarmac views. Food selection is limited to prepackaged sandwiches in a fridge at the bar. Free wifi for 3 hours with a coupon available at the reception which was manned by a very friendly lady. I believe there were around 3 shower rooms. "

New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page8," One of SIA's better offerings. Decor is nice and airy, a great view from full sized windows to the outside world, the food is very decent and even has good sandwiches - sometimes all I want is a snack before boarding, but none of the lounges at Changi have halfway decent sandwiches, I just cannot fathom that. The management at Changi need to go to LHR to look at how a lounge should be. "

Changes to bar staff work schedule at T3 SKL F,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8100-/page1," They have recently adjusted the times the bars will be manned in the SKL's. T2 SKL remains the same at 15:30 to 21:00, when the guy from T2 SKL F goes over to work in T3 SKL F. This is because they now want someone for the bar in TPR so when the guy from T2 arrives just after 21:00, one of them goes in there and the other works in T3 SKL F bar until 23:00. The T3 SKL F now also only has bar staff from 18:00 each day rather than the previous 15:30 a la T2. "

Keen to find out but only got an ex-SIN booking in March "

More than 1 guest in lounges?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3816-/page1," I was thinking last night... consider this scenario In an airport with multiple lounges, say for instance SIN, I think it would be possible to visit one lounge (eg SKL T2) with a guest to give them access, then go to another lounge (eg SKL T3) to give another guest access. Obviously you would be leaving one guest behind on his/her lonesome, but it would work, right? Or you could leave one guest in the lounge, exit, and try to come back in with another guest (to the same lounge), but I think that would be pushing your luck a little too far! "

More than 1 guest in lounges?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3816-/page1, Yes I'm sure this would work as JJPB3 said they not police who is leaving the lounge. However is it really worth it to get someone else into the lounge. It would mean that you and your travel companions are then spread out over several lounges. If these were people I liked enough to go to a lot of trouble getting them into a lounge I would prefer to skip the lounge so we could all sit together out in the main terminal area.

I am wondering if there is any where (*a G lounge etc) where i can freshen up on arrival (quick shower), and if there is somewhere SAFE (knowing JNB reputation) to leave my case. I dont want to travel to my clients offices with a suitcase in tow, but i wondered how early i can check in my case at JNB for the flight to CPT. I know i can book a ""day room"" at the intercontinental, which will save me the effort, but it I begrudge paying £150GBP for a shower and a left lugage !

Lounge/Left luggage/Check in at JNB,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5843-/page1, AFAIK no arrivals lounge (except on SA and BA). I don't remember seeing luggage storage at JNB international terminal. No idea if they have it at domestic. 
Lounge/Left luggage/Check in at JNB,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5843-/page1," You might well be able to check your luggage in to CPT on arrival at JNB. Try to through check it to CPT when you board the LX flight. It will be offloaded in JNB and you have to take it through customs, but then check it straight back with SA airside. They must be used to this since they require all transit bags coming from overseas to be collected and rechecked. I did something similar and it must have been easy because I was in a daze after not sleeping on an overnight flight from CAI. Failing that, why not just take the suitcase to your meeting? It will make you look exotic and remind your clients you have gone to no small inconvenience to see them. "

No particular reason, but Landside has more shower booths vs airside. Once you go to airside and the line is so long you might miss your shower and fly smelly. If the landside is full they can check and verify if you can shower airside. Just a higher chance of not missing a shower. "

Nice ambience similar to SKL J T3, feeling of space. Much better food selection than before. A couple of SKL ladies going around the lounge to offer tea/coffee & snacks from the trolley during my visit. Restrooms are also enhanced to be similar to T3 style, but can be better (not a fan of separated toilet/shower). Now looking forward to the new F side. "

Not surprising as I never saw anyone get anything from there. TPR is quite similar to BA's CCR. It's nice, quiet and 'exclusive' most of the time but the menu you order from is very limited so you find yourself going back into SKL F (or BA F lounge in BA's case) if you want anything else.

On top of this he was on his phone with the volume turned up so loud you could hear him before you could see him. At first I thought it may be me thinking this was inappropriate, for anywhere never mind a business lounge like this, but I was sat past him and facing the entrance and I could see by the looks on all pax and staff that walked past him that he looked and was behaving like a ****.

The C lounge however still managed to horrify me - it was small, smokey and dreary, with very faded and tattered blue seats.

A bit spartan but at least the lighting was more cheery and there wasn't any lingering smell of cigarette smoke. A small (and mostly Chinese) selection of papers and magazines. 3 computer terminals, old but functional. The food was extremely bad, especially for an F lounge, but that's probably because some of the passengers would take away anything that wasn't bolted to the floor.

First impression was that this lounge is spacious and newish. But that good feeling was dashed once I learned they do not serve their hot food buffet outside of limited meal times. For example, I got to the lounge at 1:15pm (my flight was the 2:30pm flight), but the buffet was already empty. I saw a sign seeing lunch is not served past 1pm. The only food offerings were tiny sandwiches the size of a matchbox (seriously) and some small cake bits and a bread station with toast and butter. In my opinion, this is ridiculous. Travellers often travel at odd times and need to eat at odd times. The old lounge was not anything special, but at least a hungry traveller could count on a few hot items, whatever time we happen to arrive at the lounge, to tide us over till we get on the plane. Also, an SQ lounge without hot food offerings is just out of the norm. This leads me to ask, the next time I am in PVG, what *G lounges are better to visit? "

If it is the same one I visited the last time I was at PVG, I actually thought it wasn't too bad... I didn't have time to check if there were showers, so agree that it would be a downer if there weren't any. Food-wise, maybe it is the time you were there. When I was there, I had the impression it was in between meal times, hence the lack of food. Other Air China lounges I have been to (Beijing, Chongqing etc) have all had food...not GREAT food, mind you, but something to fill the stomach... What I did appreciate was the full service bar. I thought the ambience and decor were fine too. I used that lounge on my recent return flight from PVG (Business class redemption), there were indeed showers which I used them before departure. They were pretty new. Just ask the attendant at the service counter inside the lounge on level 2 where the dining room is, you have to exchange your boarding pass for a key. "
SIA KrisFlyer Gold Lounge - Changi T3 (Open from May 2022),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/356279-sia-krisflyer-gold-lounge-changi-t3-open-from-may-2022/page1," Hello everyone, the new SQ KrisFlyer Gold Lounge in Changi T3 has reopened from 20 May 2022. This should reduce the strain on the T3 SilverKris Lounge, which has been bursting at the seams in recent months due to the resurgence in travel. Earlier this week, fellow SQTalker CarbonMan visited the lounge before his late evening flight, and kindly gave me permission to share some pictures he took of the lounge. All pics in the remainder of this post are credited to CarbonMan. Large open seating area... Workstations and counter seating... Buffet dining... Fruit and salad... Hot selections... Cold beverages, including beer... Coffee... ...and tea... I haven't visited the lounge myself, but from these pics, it does look very comfortable, and as mentioned, adds much needed lounge capacity to SIA and Star Alliance at T3. With this lounge open, I believe KrisFlyer Gold and Star Alliance Gold who are travelling Economy / Premium Economy will no longer be eligible to use the SilverKris Lounge, and will instead be asked to use this lounge instead. From other reports, this lounge also has showers and a selection of wines and liquor. Anyone who is visiting this lounge, please feel free to add more pics to this thread! Thanks again, CarbonMan, for the great pics! "

There are now no less than two ice cream fridges - the original one over by the spirits, and a new one near the tea/coffee machine. On the down side, there wasn't much of a selection of teas available yesterday - only English breakfast and Earl Grey. Also the freshly cut fruit has gone.

[SFO] VS - Clubhouse,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/456-/page1," I have not made my effort to visit this lounge. Always in a rush when connecting at SFO. Thus drop the idea for VS lounge, except for my last flight with DFP when I had time from 6pm till midnight for that particular SQ 1 D. The VS lounge is not airside. There is a lift to go up to the mezzanine near the hallway to go to the USAir Satelitte. So basically you have to go to the opposite direction from where SQ check-in and security for gate 91-10s. Again, I am sure the opening time should depend on the VS flight schedule that day. Will check the openinng time next week when I am flying out SFO to FRA. Note: I believe Lobster had visited this place last summer. "

But I was on a VS flight not a SQ one. I think my flight left about 4pm and they were definitely shuting up when we left. Anyway great lounge not as good as the LHR CH of course but a good range of food, waitress service and good views over the apron. "

I believe this is (or at least was pre-LHR overhaul) the v-flyer lot's favourite VS CH. "

I've posted in TOF, that I accessed the CH at SFO in Jul this year, flying SQ 15. Lounge was great, good view of the tarmac. Pretty neat decor, something that you would expect from VS, having read lounge and trip reports. But no real foods when I was there. I remember having a salad and some cheese (which was quite a good assortment, actually). Took over 45 min for the salad to be done which I felt was a tad long, but I'm not complaining. Pity didn't have time to check out the SKL and the RCC as I was running late, though on hindsight, I should have just popped in the RCC for the drink chits. Was literally running over to the G gates for pre-boarding screening, and the SQ gate was like 89 which was all the way to the end. Service was great, but don't recall having free internet computers. I remembered having 2 or 3 computers near the entrance, but you needed a uid and pw to login. So, my opinion is the check in way early, just sthg to eat at the CH, then head over to RCC and SKL closer to departing time. Leave ample time for screening. "

[FRA] Which Lounges can I and should I use in FRA?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3892-/page1," Dear All, I go to Fra on a regular basis and lounge access is something I am not very familiar with. The last time I was in FRA flying back on SQ 25, I was allowed access to LH Senator Lounge near gate 45 in Terminal 1. I am a measly QPPS (based on today's downgraded priority system) and typically fly C Class on SQ. Have a couple of questions to ask: a. Am I allowed LH Senator Lounge access flying C Class with QPPS (I thought I was given an exceptional access to that lounge on the last trip but it was mess anyway when traveling with another F Class pax and a C Class pax )? b. What is the best lounge to use in Fra? Is the United's Red Carpet a better one than LH Senator? c. Any other lounges I can use? Did not liked LH Lounges but Senator still better than LH Business Lounge....so not complaining loudly. Any advices and thoughts will be appreciated. "
[FRA] Which Lounges can I and should I use in FRA?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3892-/page1," If you are taking SQ 25 or SQ325 from FRA, the better lounge would be the LH SEN lounge. I know it's crowded, but once you find your little corner or seat, you are good. AFAIK, QPP in J will be invited to LH SEN, unless this has changed. Between UA RCC and LH SEN, I prefer LH SEN. For the flights above, UA RCC would be too far away, i.e. near towards Terminal C. Thus LH SEN or even LH Business Class would be more convenient for Gate B48 departure. Of course, the ideal would be being guested to the LH First Class lounge near the Casino at Terminal B. Mile better in terms of food/snacks and drinks. "
[FRA] Which Lounges can I and should I use in FRA?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3892-/page1," Last year flying out on SQ325, I did go into LH Senator lounge after an argument with the dragon since I was given an invitation to the LH Business lounge at check-in. However, I came out as soon as I had walked in because the lounge was just too messy and crowded. I then went to the LH Business lounge which in my opinion was far more spacious and less crowded. The shower facility at the Business lounge was better as well. I would actually opt for the LH Business Lounge. If I am not mistaken, this is also the closest lounge to departure gates as well. "

But for that early morning, I will go there because it's better place to wait than at the gate, unless I want to have good espresso from one of the cafe. The suggestion by florianwagner to use LH SEN is not that feasible. First, for pax who check-in at FRA for SQ26 to JFK, it will get hassled by the security heading into Terminal B. But of course, this based on me being non-caucasian and non-german speaking. Second, from LH SEN lounge at Terminal B to reach Terminal C, there will be a security check, x-ray, which is pretty busy that early morning due to the fact that UA and AA flights are departing from Terminal C, and many pax will go through this security check point. In the case of SQ25 or SQ325 which the flights are departing from Terminal B, usually Gate B48, yes, I use LH SEN, and usually I show my SEN card. For SQ C pax, now I remember that most of the time they will be directed to the LH Business Lounge which is located in the upper floor in the middle section of Pier B40-B48. "

But if flying SQ F/R (as opposed to UA, LH, etc) then TPR is the F lounge. This is not the same issue as the designated *G lounge, or a F lounge for other airlines, but when flying SQ F one is allowed in TPR. According to *A rules, F pax are allowed a guest in the designated F lounge. Therefore SQ F pax should be allowed a guest in TPR. "

I'm not sure I agree but I could be wrong... The way I see it: When flying non-SQ F, the designated *A lounge is the SKL F (and you can take a guest in as per *A rules) When flying SQ F/R, the designated *A lounge is still the SKL F (and you can take a guest in as per *A rules). However, SQ (outside of the *A rules) is now allowing its F/R pax to also go into TPR. "

Some of these F and R pax sound like nasty piece's of work, not wanting the TPP and LPP riff-raff in their lounge. Perhaps not a survey, but pax sent feedbacks? Again, F and R pax who are here on line, are not representing the whole F and R pax. We don't mind to invite others to the lounge. And again, not all Solitaire are like us. Have seen many many times in SKL F lounge, how those Solitaire were a real pita while at the lounge, and created a scene, which indeed I could feel at that time I wish that being paid F pax at that time, I would not be in the same room as them. Of course not all Solitaire like that. But when that happened, those pitas tainted the whole milk. Again, you may look at me as weak. But really, when I fly in Y (even in J), being LPP, having access to SKL F is a bless. I am not going to scream wanting access to TPR. When I am in F, I have different expectation. Yes, I don't mind to have you guys as my guests, and I love to be with you guys, since I know you guys are not pitas. But when there are pitas who are not even flying in F and creating unfriendly and unpleasant environment in the F lounge, I could share the view why the majority feedback came back as R/F only. We shall see how TPR is. What's there to offer. Any uniqueness? Until I experience it myself and knowing opinion from others, I have no further comment. "

The title of the press release states 'set to redefine Airport Lounge Experience', it mentions 'new design concept' numerous times, also advises of 'testing and evaluation of prototypes' and then 'the next generation of SilverKris Lounges'.

Now of course, we are all well aware of SQ's recent track record of doing things as cheaply as possible, and of course it could well be that 'ONG&ONG was selected following an extensive tender exercise involving the participation of both local and international design firms' because they were the cheapest, just like the new website creators.

Not even back to flying properly yet, and already full. I guess its a combination of factors: 1) Loads in the premium cabins are indeed up. 2) The Silver Kris lounge now has to accomodate Stargolds; Business Class pax from Partner airlines as well as First Class pax in what is essentially only the Business class lounge. 3) More worrisome though - SQ's operations used to be divided between T2 and T3 with a separate Silver Kris lounge complex, serving each terminal, so its likely a capacity decrease (even more so if you read this article - https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/bru...remium-lounges, which says that though the upcoming T3 SK Lounge complex is larger in size by 30% compared to the former and can accomodate over 1000pax at a go ... the same article states that the current Qantas First + Business class lounges can accomodate 800 over pax ... which for a non Singapore based carrier is generous especially compared to the 1000+ pax capacity of the upcoming SK Lounges in T3 in total!) The above illustrates how limited in capacity the upcoming SK lounges actually are - unless there are plans for another SK Lounge complex in T2 or maybe even T1... now that SQ's operations are divided in these two terminals.

A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1, Hello! So I am off to EWR on the SQ22 next weekend. My BF is flying to BKK on Thai the same morning... my question is (as I can't remember and think I am going mad) ... can I take him into the KF lounge in T3 as my guest? Joanna Thin. 
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1," Firstly - what is your status in Star Alliance, what class are you travelling? And you mean Krisflyer Gold lounge, not SilverKris Lounge, right? "
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1," SQ22 is all C. If you do not have any SQ PPS status, you are unable to bring him to the Silver Kris Lounge. A Business boarding pass does not allow guest. But if you have Star Alliance Gold, then yes, you can bring him to the Krisflyer Gold lounge. "
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1," Also - does your BF have any Star Alliance Gold status or are they travelling in J? And although it's not technically allowed, a J BP (paid, but I don't think that mattered this time), has allowed me to bring a guest into the SKL last year once... haven't tried since. "
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1, I am star gold with BMI and he is silver with TG and I am silver Kris Elite so reckon we can all get in the krisflyer gold lounge only ??? 
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1," Based on your BMI Gold, both of you can access the Gold Lounge only... but you can always try to both get into the SKL however it's up to the lounge attendants to make a decision to allow / reject your BF (however, you yourself will be allowed in) "
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1," I have managed to twice bring in a guest to the SKL based on my J boarding pass and LH*G. In fact, when I showed up at the KF lounge, the lounge dragon directed me and my guest to the SKL instead. Both times though, my guests were on the same flight albeit in Y and that was in June. "
A little question regarding lounge accessssss [at SIN T3]...,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/7480-/page1," I haven't yet heard of a case where someone had a C BP + *G but was relegated to KFGL for both - anyone experienced this first hand? Somehow I have a feeling that C BP + *G = SKL J for two, simply because I think the primary access eligibility of having the C BP is more important to them than the guest eligibility of *G status, which is somewhat incidental to the access for the main passenger.

I had hoped to take a quick shower at the United RC Lounge, but was directed to LUFTHANSA LOUNGE near Gate B14 (IIRC). The lounge was fairly deserted at 630AM, but there is no SHOWER! :-( I was going to go to UA Lounge, but was told it closed 2 months ago. The only way to use a shower is to go to F Lounge *IF* I have a Gold *A card. :-( It looks like a pretty new lounge to me, but the lighting was hideous -- while some lounges can look pretty sexy, this one looks just like... an airport lounge. Too bad. "

They are renovating the airport (as they do for the last 20 years...) and the RC had to go for this. The LH lounge in that spot in Terminal B therefore is usually totally overrun. Lufthansa has a bunch of lounges (10, not counting the LH-F lounges/terminal) in FRA. They might not have a shower in the lounge, because most (?) of their customers come from Germany or fly to Germany. In the first case you probably don't need a shower, in the latter you either have to go to Terminal A, where you they have showers in the lounges or you use the arrival lounge. "

The best option for you with a business class ticket is to use the LH Arrivals Lounge landside - where you get almost a F-class shower cabin, decent eats and seating - they're open only until 1300 hours though, and they are pretty strict about whether they let you in or not. You shouldn't have a problem with a C-class boarding card, but then they might ask why you didn't stay in the transit area. You could always make up a story that you had to do shopping or something... "

No access to LH FCT/FCLs so SEN lounge is as good as it gets. SEN lounge by the high numbered B40s gates is the closest & most convenient (for FRA-SIN).

I hope there is somewhere / some locker to store my luggage, as I really do not want to be dragging along two cabin-sized bags and a chocolate cake for the lady halfway across the desert. Just an advance warning, European is more strict with carry on even though you are flying in C. You have 2 cabin size bags plus a cake. I would be pessimistic about it. Another think to consider is the fact that you will stop in two places which are hot (no not hot dot dot dots... but hot temperature wise ). What do you think will happen to your sacher torte?

Do you know that many young college students in the US or Canada (the two countries I have lived) do not have much money? Not all their parents are rich. How could they spend time in Europe or even the UK which are very expensive? They take public transit when they are on their holiday in Europe or UK. My point is, that you don't have to be filthy rich to visit Dubai for 12 hours. If there is a will, there will be a way. "
[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page2," I would be spending >24 hours in DXB by myself in Dec. So this thread is extremely useful to me. Some information just cannot be found in the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide. Thanks. Originally posted by Kyo View Post I will be travelling with probably two cabin-size bags (and probably a box of sacher torte in tow). Therefore, I don't think I can check this in at VIE and expect it to go all the way through on 3 different airlines to Bangkok, some 2-3 days later, right? I'm also not keen to carry a huge chocolate cake through the Dubai dessert. For fear of melting... or being attacked by hungry camels. Kyo, I do not think there is a problem dumping the cake in the check-in bags. The cake comes in a wooden box. The cake itself is also rather hard. Should be quite resistant to getting squashed. I do not remember having to worry about the chocolate melting either. But then again, I was only travelling between Austria and London. I do not find the sacher torte that nice. We did have some discussion about the real torte in the VIE thread. Originally posted by SQ LPP View Post I would say you have a misconception here. We all live to adapt and to adjust.

On my first trip to Europe 13 years ago, I had jam and bread for breakfast nearly everyday. Most of my main meals were very simple too. No fancy meals or Michelin stars for me in those days. I travel on public transport. I still do that now!!! Across Europe and most of SE Asia. I hardly ever take the cab. I'm planning my NY trip for Aug. Hotels can be expensive! We've gone down the Priceline route and have found somewhere decent and reasonable. I didn't know DXB can be expensive. Looks like the Sheikh option is getting increasingly attractive. "

I may need the hidden Swiss bank account numbers + access codes of that evil CGK or risk returning back to Singapore on one of my ships... Dubai isn't that expensive... especially compared to Europe... taxis are still pretty cheap - it costs me about 30DHS to get from Emirates Towers (Sheikh Zayed Rd) to the airport... or maybe 50 each way to get to the Dubai creek/souk. also food can be found cheap... you can pick up a shawarma (like a kebab... why can't i find those in singapore?!) for about DHS10, or even less if you're lucky... The biggest problem can be finding a taxi in dubai... if its busy they never stop unless you're white & giong to jumeriah...sometimes its taken me 2 hours to get a cab! a good tip is to walk into a nice hotel via side entrance... walk out thru the main entrance & pretend you're staying there & need to get to the airport, the porters will hail a cab for you & sort you out. also taxis are more likely to stop at hotels. its not really a place you can walk from area to area easily (distances are pretty big) and the buses are just crap... i wouldn't recommend them, even for a student however there is a hop-on hop off bus which goes to all the major sites... just be careful as some buses aren't airconditioned (then you'll definately need that shower!) where the costs come in is if you're eating in the top hotels, sleeping in the top hotels, or going out to the clubs etc... however for a day trip you can do it reletively inexpensively.

[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page2," According to this article late last year: Passengers in the 42 Royal Silk Business Class seats on each flight from Dubai to Bangkok are treated to luxuriously commodious comfort with a host of additional benefits such as:- • use of premium class airport lounges in Thais' major on-line destinations Just to make sure, I then decided to walk into the Thai Airways office to just ask - and they confirm that the LH *A lounge will accept C or F or *G, ROP passengers. However for some odd reason, the lounge is not open between 9am - 3pm. (This, they are re-confirming if this is a 24-hour lounge as the computer system showed opening hours of 15:00PM - 00:00AM, and then 00:01 - 09:00) I will add this to the first post reflecting the same. SQ LPP: I have researched every possible connection I could think of (yes, even Czech and Montenegro, Belarus and Sarajevo, the lot...). However, please feel free to correct me if you can find another without any backtracking. The only availability with Biz (and without backtracking, most importantly) was via IST and DXB (which I don't mind anyway). If you look on Great Circle, it's almost a straight line even. Ultimately my stopover on the way back to SIN had to be through BKK to attend my gf's b'day (that's what the cake is for). Thanks also for the heads up about Europe's strict adherence to the 2-bag policy (I was also gonna bring a laptop bag). However now, I am considering getting a 'Linzer' torte instead as it will/hopefully should not melt and put that into the main bag I intend to check-in (or dump into a DXB locker, if they have one). The small-sized 'Sacher torte' that will probably fit into the main bag also. I will only carry my backpack around Dubai. Relating to your comments on cost - I have no car, so I think it's not easy for me to say I had one?!? I have no intention of getting a car in Singapore either. I do use the cabs here quite a lot, almost daily basis. As for expensive public transport, I think even Dubai will have a hard time competing with my 1-hour taxi ride into Narita airport costing me a whopping 21,300 Yen after missing my Airport Express. Mistakes happen sometimes, I'm prepared for it... as for the Oktoberfest (not going anymore). I have a simple philosophy of how I spend money... work hard, play even harder. It works so far. I won't spend what I cannot afford. This time, thanks to the VIE DO, I took a chance on Europe, I'm glad it paid off. I intend to fully enjoy myself / celebrate a little because of that. On the flip side, I can't / am unwilling to pay for a night in the Burj-Al-Arab, so I won't. I might have a misconception of how expensive Dubai is, but knowing some shipping guys there (and more-or-less their crazy salaries/subsequently their crazy expenditure) - I think it is not unreasonable for me to simply not want to book a hotel when I'm only transiting for half a day. I would not mind if one day you come to Singapore, will gladly extend an invitation for a coffee. You always give sound advice, and are quite humble (in the 2 yrs I've observed). I appreciate it! Even if I fly mostly in Y or J, and not F as you do, I hope to also show the same over time. Only time will tell, right? jhm: The Thai officer was not confident in being able to check in on OS all the way through to Bangkok from Vienna. She said for safety, I should only check it in as far as Dubai, collect the luggage and re-check it at the counters in Dubai to ensure it would arrive in Bangkok. phaleesy: I was just reading Lonely Planet on Dubai too! I like how they describe the Burj's interior as 'gaudy'... I did explore their website last year, and it did look rather outrageous... but it's just one of those things to tick off the checklist of things to do in Dubai, rather like having a Singapore Sling in Singapore is visiting the Burj Al Arab for coffee (I see they have a canapes and cocktails set too for 200 DHM) Will definitely aim to go a little bit nuts as it's my first time in the mid-East. matt_will_fix_it: To put it one way, the very little time I've got there, I will try to make the most out of. If I eat too much in VIE, I will use DXB to slim down... hehe (fat chance) SQFAN: Too bad I don't think I will get sheikhs knocking on my door anytime soon "

I'd always take something like that in my hand carry. Are you sure you don't want a hotel ? You arrive at 5am and depart 14 hours later. Looking on spg.com for 28-29 September, you can get the Four Points (for example) for only AED 375 (about S$140). The website says it's 12 minutes from the airport by car. I'd seriously consider the room because: * I can leave all my luggage (including the valuable cakes) safe in the (aircon) room; * The opportunity to freshen up after a day of sightseeing in Dubai (the bathroom facilities are going to be much better than any lounge) before heading for the airport * If I feel tired, there's a bed for some proper sleep (If you do go for a hotel, you'd have to check that they'd allow you to check-in so early.)

[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page2," Oh, just to mention also that I flew LHR-DXB-BAH-DXB-LHR last year. I left London after work on Friday evening, arrived in Dubai the next morning, flew to BAH (met and had lunch there with SQFAN), back to DXB in the afternoon, 7 or 8 hours in the LM near the airport (some sleep and dinner), back to DXB airport around midnight and arrived back in London on Sunday morning. The DXB hotel wasn't essential but I didn't fancy the thought of trying to kill 7-8 hours in DXB in the evening and then arrive at the airport without having had a shower beforehand. (DXB airport is also horrible IMHO - packed full of people sleeping on the floor etc.) "

[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page2," Kyo Sorry about this late response as I have just returned from IST to DXB (my base). Pls check the visa requirements for Dubai as they have just implemented new regulations. Only 33 countries have been exempted. See the link below. However can't seem to find the list of 33 countries. http://www.dnrd.gov.ae/DNRD/News%20A..._Detail?id=301 Burj is expensive and requires advance booking just to see the place (friend of mine paid US$500 for himself and his missus for high tea and came away very disappointed - all hype and no substance) Yes, Gold souq is unique only if you like gold jewellery done in indian style (aka very yellow in color). if diamond is your thing, then head over to gold and diamond park (very close to the Mall of Emirates) where you can get european cuttings at wholesale price. For 15 hours, I agree the Big Bus tour is your best option. But I don't think they will start that early around 5am. They operate several routes using the spanking new china double deck coaches with an AC lower deck. DXB is like Las Vegas without the casinos. So they do well with man made things like shopping malls. The ones not to be missed: Mall of Emirates with SkiDubai, Ibn Battuta Mall (almost half way to Abu Dhabi but worth the trip), Medinat Souq Jumeirah and Wafi Mall. Each of them all vying for one up man ship... If malls are not your thing, then you could try the wild wadi which is a water theme park. A boat ride (abra) across the Dubai Creek would be another activity you can try as part og the gold souq program. I could share more about DXB more later so as not to bore others. So I suggest you start with a big healthy breakfast as you will not find food or drinks during the day. 29 Sep is still in the month of Ramadan and you are not allowed to eat and drink in the open. You can only find food served in hotels in an enclosed section and you can forget alcohol altogether. As for airport lounges, Emirates F/C excepted, the Diners Card lounge is the next best alternative. Sorry, no shower facilities there. Ditto for LH *A lounge. Merhaba Lounge is also marginally better and again no shower facilities. One possible solution for the shower after sweating in the humid sep heat would be to use a gym facility in the malls. the nearest one is the aviation club/akaru spa which is near the airport and may be they can let you use the facilities on a per use basis.

I would like to know where you get your facts , 1- where did I ever say my family screamed at the staff at the lounge. I am in the service business, my family treats people with respect , especially the people serving us , lounge staff, flight attendents , check in personal etc , even after being rejected entry my wife said she said thank you and left. If you think my daughters comment , that the bags got treated better than themselves, that part is true the bags got priority stickers on them and were some of the first ones off in singapore. As to the comment, how did the staff know why wife is a member for 22 years, she showed the women the card, in the lower middle it states years qualified 22 years. Why would I have to contact senior staff for an exception to the lounge, are you telling me that lounge staff have no distraction, and if they allow one extra person in they will be fired, are the rules that strict with SQ, about giving away a lounge access, if that is the case they have a lot more problems than a website . I will give you an example about 15 years ago my wife, myself and daughter flew on Virgin to London, on the return departure we went to the Vigin lounge and the RULES said only pps members no guests, when we approaced the woman at the door we showed are two Solitaire, and asked if we could enter with our daughter as she was only 5 , the woman thought for a moment and said sure, I dodnt think she would be fired for this breach of company policy, didnot have to ask senior management for a waiver. My employees have latitude in dealing with questions and procedures, we donot have a rule book cut in stone, like I guess SQ does. "

But personally, since you are arriving around midnight, and usually I am not that sleepy, I will stay at T3 SKL. And if you want to lay down, there is that flat sofa in the C side of SKL T3. (See the picture in the SKL T3 C side thread). Of course if you want to, and room is available, you can go to Transit Hotel at T3, which is better than the one in T2 or T1. For your return, if you are in UA Y, I believe you can not use SKL, just the KrisFlier Gold lounge (even though you are Solitaire).

I'll be traveling with 3 others on TG to NZ come this December. Considering that I'm flying a *A partner on Y Class, I presume I should have Lounge access using my EG Card right?

Lounge & Guests,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4061-/page1," *G status allows 1 guest. Some lounges (mostly in USA) sell daypasses, which you could buy to bring in more guests. However I don't think TG sells daypasses. If the extra passengers with you are very young (think toddlers or young children), then most lounges will allow them entry with their *G parents. But YMMV. "

I was mere trying to rationalize why SQ might be integrating the lounges as SQJunkie posted, my assumption being that SQ knows what they're doing! How would you explain why they'd want to integrate the lounges then? That would be a rather strange marketing perspective to adopt. Why would the SKL be the brand that is being optimized? The relevant brands are SQ First Class, SQ Business Class and SQ Economy Class. Isn't the lounge experience a very integral part of the premium cabin travel experience? If I were SQ, I would want SKL to be a very strong brand that travelers would identify with well. What a strange line of logic.

And even though J lounge often gets extremely crowded due to the higher number of J and status pax so it would be a distinctly less desirable atmosphere? Yes that's the downside I thought about too. It would be a downgrade for those flying in F. ButSurely this wouldn't be for Changi where the F lounge is spectacular with its specialised sub-lounge with an a la carte menu, The Private Room. I have only been to the T2 and T3 Changi ones, never been to the overseas ones so you tell me. Beyond how crowded it is, is there a distinction between the F and J lounges?

The lounge features wireless Internet access, a business centre with desktop computers, shower rooms and restrooms, televisions, as well as a selection of warm food and light snacks. The SilverKris Lounge is a key element in Singapore Airlines premium service offering, which begins on the ground and continues in the air. The new lounge, together with our four daily Seoul flights, demonstrates our commitment to the important South Korean market, said SIAs General Manager Korea, Mr Sia Nam Kung. In August 2012, Singapore Airlines announced an investment of S$20 million in SilverKris Lounges over five years to enhance the travel experience of its customers. At the same time, SIA appointed renowned architectural and interior design firm ONG&ONG to develop a new design concept to be applied to all its airport lounges worldwide. The new design concept will be rolled out progressively to SilverKris Lounges from later this year, beginning with the lounge at Sydney Airport. Including a recently opened lounge at Delhi Airport in India, Singapore Airlines now has 15 SilverKris Lounges at airports around the world. The Incheon Airport SilverKris Lounge has a seating capacity of 96.

The lounge boasts more personal work spaces inside the workstation pod seats and new SIA-only high-back armchairs. Passengers will also be able to get a taste of home with the lounges serving local dishes like laksa and mee siam, with First Class passengers enjoying butler services The lounge will also features art pieces that showcase Singapore and the country of departure.

I would like to ask if I can gain access if I produce the card instead of having 'TPP' on my boarding pass as I would like to have my Mileage Plus number instead for mileage accrual. Can I do the same for the SKL in Singapore too? 
[JFK] VS - Clubhouse,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/197-/page3," A currently valid card plus a VS or SQ BP get you in, as long as the name matches the one on the BP. In any case, wouldn't 'TPP' appear on your SQ BP even if accruing on MP? "

[HKG] SKL at HKIA (post-renovation),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3208-/page3," Without having seen a master floorplan, I'd surmise that the T shape of the new lounge tucks the larger dining area on the right branch of the T behind the old SKL J section. If so, that would mean that the lavatory and shower area of the old SKL is adjacent to the pantry area of the new SKL. In that event, SQ could revamp the lavatory and shower area of the old SKL so the decor matches the new SKL and then open that up to the new lounge. The place to do that would be the walkway beside the pantry area-- a door could be punched in there fairly easily, and the location would make sense. Remains to be seen... but it would be unusual, wouldn't it, to have such a big and nice SKL without showers, nevermind lavs. So I suspect they're going in this direction. "

C ticket but F access granted,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/10148-/page1," I had what I think is an usual experience with lounge access; any insight into what may have occurred (or some education for me!) would be appreciated. I recently flew LAX-(NRT)-SIN in F on a redemption ticket. I had a separate, paid ticket SIN-DPS in C. When I checked-in in LAX I was given boarding passes for both flights. Once in SIN I looked more closely at the SIN-DPS boarding pass and noticed that it said something along the lines of ""You are invited to the First Class Silver Kris Lounge."" When I went to the lounge in T3 the agent saw the blue boarding pass and initially directed me to the C side, but when I pointed out the first class invite I was directed to the F side with no hesitation on the agent's part. Did something funny happen here? My understanding was always that lounge access is strictly based on the departing flight. Thanks! "

Dedicated spaces for each with shared facilities, unless there is flexibility some will be peeved to be in a crowded space when the other side is empty? Emirates will need to renovate the washrooms/showers again when KFG goes ""home"" after the amount of usage they will get in 2yrs.....see that with the uselessness of the HKG facilities always under maintenance. With only SATS and DBS available on the ""left"" side of T3, not a lot of options for where to relocate. "
Big changes coming to SKL / TPR / KF G at T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15196-/page3," I've mostly only been to the main Business and First Silverkris lounges in T3, only once to the Krisflyer Gold one so I can't comment on the latter. But for the former, the Business lounge gets crazy crowded in the early mornings and late evenings. It looks classy, and has decent food and beverage but that's it. Looking at what's been released of the planned revamp so far, I understand there will be a 30% increase in capacity but that is not going to cut it and surely they have plans to grow in capacity like any other business? Have the SQ execs been to the lounge at 11 PM on any day? You can barely get a seat. With a 30% increase in space, it's still going to be super crowded. You should have ample space in a flagship lounge of a premium airline and not have to squeeze for crying out loud. And it looks like the highlight is the bar which is what just about every other airline lounge has already. Hell even the pay-per-use Plaza Premium lounge has one. I'm not hopeful it's going to be anything special. Knowing SQ, their idea of ""innovation"" and ""enhancement"" is probably not going to extend much beyond 30% more seats and that bar, and definitely not anything that would increase the cost of maintaining the lounge, with like say a spa. They can't even be bothered to come up with a decent arrangement for the nearly 2 years that their lounges would be out of commission, funneling all their Business and First passengers into that very basic lounge that's a quarter of the size of the main complex "

SQ keep complaining they have to compete unfairly against Middle East airlines but it is the same with lounges that are, typically, huge. The old TK lounge in Istanbul was very large and also, at late nights and early mornings, packed, so there is a lot hanging on the new airport that I've not passed through yet.

The lounge is shared with the Marhaba lounge as everyone has alluded to here already. There are two entrances - one for 'Marhaba' lounge, and another for Krisflyer Gold. This is done probably just to separate the entry systems and easier to figure out who has access I suppose. The lounge is truly shared. Inside the space is connected with a common F&B area in the middle so regardless which way you entered you end up in same space. Size wise probably 25-50% smaller than the original Krisflyer Gold Lounge so I'm expecting it will get a little cosy during peak times. F&B wise I would say a good step up in this lounge. They have wider buffet spread, and even satay (a good fix for those based overseas while transiting Singapore)! There is a dedicated Tiger beer dispenser parked against the side wall by the Krisflyer Gold entrance side. Wifi they advertised dedicated Krisflyer AP but nowhere to be found. If you ask the staff they'll hand you a little slip with the Marhaba Wifi connection details. "

As long its nothing offensive, who are we to judge? Not wearing any shoes &/ stinking does not speak very well of the individual as being not respectful, but I do not think that one have to be a snob to fly comfortably in premium. "

Dress code TPR barefoot wanderer in dining room,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13800-/page1," It's a privilege to fly, but under the circumstances, I would like to extend the discussion to dress codes on the plane, as this bloke obviously flew in from a flight from somewhere. If he flew first class, good on him, at least he'll have neighbours at least some distance away; however, the space in the ""tube"" is rather limited, and if you paid a similar ""fare"" to be comfortable, what tolerance should one accept? I have no problems with dressing to the occasion - appropriately!! A ""snob"" is defined in the dictionary as ""a ​person who ​respects and ​likes only ​people who are of a high ​social ​class, and/or a ​person who has ​extremely high ​standards who is not ​satisfied by the things that ​ordinary ​people like:"" This has got nothing to do with it!!

Dress code TPR barefoot wanderer in dining room,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13800-/page1, I agree with SQflyergirl and Cashsuds that some limits should be set. I find it quite inconsiderate for anyone to board a plane (regardless of cabin class) smelly and unclean. It is also a form of respect to the property to at least wear some footwear to an airport lounge...at least in my opinion. So I make it a point not to be too sloppy myself. Nothing to do with being snobbish...just being considerate and respectful. 
Dress code TPR barefoot wanderer in dining room,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13800-/page1," In Australia, all must wear footwear to enter the airport and board planes and go into lounges. Footwear is a must. If you don't have a shirt on in the airport, it's likely you'll be arrested for public nuisance offence (if you don't leave when required to do so by police). Never been to airport where someone is not wearing a shirt or footwear. "
Dress code TPR barefoot wanderer in dining room,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13800-/page1," My worst experience was on a SAS flight to CPH from SIN. At the BKK stopover, a seriously drunk came onboard and sat next to me in J, mumbling all sorts of expletives as he got into his seat, and sounding as if he just visited some whorehouse just before taking the flight. He stank of alcohol and heavens-know-what but the killer moment was when he took off his shoes. I went into immediate involuntary retroperistalsis. Thank goodness I didn't eat much on the SIN-BKK leg. Despite this event happening more than a decade ago, it is indelibly etched into my memory. The point I'm making is that he was ""properly"" dressed, but how does one put in a rule for BO - retching test? And the enforcement of it will also be tricky especially on a person with reduced mental faculties. "

However, as well as I mentioned above about the lounge dragon saying they would like to keep it to their own pax, following is reply to an email.... 'Yes, Star Alliance Gold members can access the lounge. However, due to the space limitation (one same lounge for first and business class), priority will have to be given to passengers who travel on Singapore Airlines flights. This is to avoid overcrowding situation.' Now, I have no problem with this, and it's not as though there aren't plenty of other options for *A pax at BKK. I just know what's coming when the first few refusals happen and the toys leave the pram... Oh so true .. Well according to this a LH *G travelling on SQ should be fine even in crowded situations - hmmm. As I'm a cheapo who travels LX on my trips to BKK I guess I wil be relegated to the TG lounge "

Like ManFlyer said, it's tucked away and the giveaways are the various SQGirl paper-cutout. Location : Effectively, after going up the transfer escalators, double back on yourself and you should see a book shop to your left. Keep walking down the corridor and the SKL will be on the left. Impression : First inpressions is a very positive one for me. Behind the semi-circular main reception area is some magazines, newspapers. On the right upon entry is the various PC stations - Sony products. The TV is located in this part as well. To the left upon entry is the food servery area and the spread is not bad. There are fried food more like onion bahji type in ahot revolving tray type display. Prewrapped sandwiches. A wide selection of soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, fruit juices as well as fresh fruits. There also a Haagen-Dazs ice cream fridge by the wall. The lounge design is that it's segmented which offers further privacy. Lighting style is unique in that you have 3 tier like lamps illuminating the lounge. ....unlike the current generation of SKL around the world. What I did not like : No toilets and shower facilities. Have taken pics and will post upon my return to UK early July. "

I was also delighted to see that the famous Ham and Cheese sandwiches they used to have in the SKL's at Don Muang have reappeared!!. However, instead of being served as 'doubles' like they were previously they are just singles now. Now, before anyone rightly points out that Ham and Cheese sandwiches are not worth getting excited about, they are excellent for getting something simple into you when you've had a heavy night out in Bangkok.

Fight broke out in the Private Room,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/10715-/page1, I was flying SQ 322 SIN-LHR on 4th Aug in Suites. About an hour before the flight I was in TPR when all of a sudden I heard a loud commotion. A woman was shouting to another man to get off her partner. Shortly after this the lounge ladies quickly ran off shouting to call for the police and later returned with a first aid kit. As I left the lounge I asked the lady on the door what happened (because of the privacy set up of TPR I couldn't see anything). Apparently here is how the story goes. A man (alone) who had too much to drink was speaking very loudly (call him man1). A guy (man2) who was with his girlfriend/wife asked man1 if he minded keeping his voice down. Man1 reacted by punching man2 in the face and man1 had to be pulled off man2. Man1 then proceeded to leave the lounge quickly as the lounge staff tried to get him to wait there for the police to arrive. I ask the lady on the door which flight these people were on and she said they were both on my flight...how lovely. As I arrived at the gate I saw one of the ladies from the room stood at the security with two police men. It seemed she was waiting to identify the man. On board I told the crew all about this and they didn't know anything about it. Later they came back and said both men were in the lounge speaking to police. A little while later man2 got on the plane with a black eye and cuts and blood all over his face. The crew confirmed man1 was off loaded and arrested. Well I do like the TPR but I have always found it so quiet that I dare not speak. I have lived in Singapore for over 6 years and have never seen anyone fighting. How funny that the first time I do is in TPR of all places! As for the flight it was as amazing as long haul suites ever is and the crew were the best I have ever experienced. Thank you SQ...again.

[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page1," QUESTION: Flying in from IST (Istanbul), will have to do a <15hrs stopover in Dubai - it will be quite a long wait for a TG flight ex DXB (Dubai) to Bangkok (BKK) as arriving early, early morning and departing only in the evening on the same day. I have a feeling Dubai is gonna be wayyyy too expensive to bother with a hotel for <15 hours. Therefore, I was wondering if TG has a *A-contracted lounge in DXB? Will be flying TG Business Class, no status (not even *S). All who have transited in Dubai (especially with TG status or Biz/First pax), please advise... Thanks in advance! I need to book this ticket quick fast! ANSWER: LH *A lounge will accept C or F or *G, ROP passengers. However for some odd reason, the lounge is not open between 9am - 3pm. (This, they are re-confirming if this is a 24-hour lounge as the computer system showed opening hours of 15:00PM - 00:00AM, and then 00:01 - 09:00) "

You are lucky in the sense that you don't need to worry about requirement (such as visa) to enter many countries in the world. If I were you, 12 hours and 45 minutes is so much time to explore something new. If dot dot dots permit (or is it called tumi porn according to taipeiflyer ), I would do that as well. I have visited many cities when the connection is that long. Springs to mind, I have been to Frankfurt for less than 12 hours, even London where it took an hour to take the tube to Oxford St. Even, I did visit Narita City, and even Tokyo while having long connection around 11 hours. Note: You said that you are taking TG to BKK from DXB. Thus the departure would be around 1040pm. Thus basically you will be in transit during the day (from 10am?). It's more logical in my opinion to go out and explore a new place. What's the appealing component in your mind that make you think you are better off waiting at the lounge for 12 hours? "
[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page1," Also if you can travel light, they should be able to check your luggage straight thru to the destination, so save having to collect your bags, lug them around all day, and then check back in... also if u get your boarding pass issued for all legs of the journey it saves on check-in times & should be able to straight thru to security... dubai is an interesting place to visit for the day (wouldn't want to stay much longer mind you )... also u could pop into the gold souk to find something for the missus to impress her with when you return...

[DXB] Any lounge for Biz pax on TG?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4592-/page1," Thanks for all the replies - very much appreciated. In case you are all wondering why I'm asking, due to a combination of travel times etc - things are going to be a *little* bit more complicated instead of straightforward: After the Vienna DO (which ends on the 28th of September), I will have to depart on the morning of the 28th... VIE-IST 13:20-16:35 on Austrian Airlines (28th PM of Sept) IST-DXB 23:25-04:55 on Turkish Airlines (28 PM - 29th early AM) DXB-BKK 17:40-05:25 on Thai Airways (29th PM - 30th early AM) So, as you can see... I will be in Dubai during the day time, morning, hopefully not too tired and exploring the souk (definitely will see the gold souk) etc. I will be travelling with probably two cabin-size bags (and probably a box of sacher torte in tow). Therefore, I don't think I can check this in at VIE and expect it to go all the way through on 3 different airlines to Bangkok, some 2-3 days later, right? I'm also not keen to carry a huge chocolate cake through the Dubai dessert. For fear of melting... or being attacked by hungry camels. SQ LPP: The appeal is showering myself off before going on board the TG flight to Bangkok (I don't think I will smell too good after 3 days otherwise). SQFAN: I might be travelling on J, but Dubai isn't exactly known for being affordable. At all. In fact, rather the opposite... don't they charge something like $50 or $75usd just to have coffee at the Burj Al Arab (which I also have to visit for sure).. matt_will_fix_it: Believe me, there's nothing I want more than to check in one of my cabin-sized bags all the way through, and maybe leave the other one in a locker or something til I get back to the airport. Just that... 3 airports, 3 cities, 3 days... no idea if this works or not?!! I will definitely need a break in a lounge if I can get it in Dubai before flying into Thailand. "

SQ LPP: It's a pity TG has no showers on their aeroplane (I may not need a 12-hour shower but at some point, I will need one to show consideration for the sake of my fellow passengers who I'm sure will not want the stench of someone smelling of a Turkish kebab + Dubaian camels). I hope there is somewhere / some locker to store my luggage, as I really do not want to be dragging along two cabin-sized bags and a chocolate cake for the lady halfway across the desert. Also thanks for pointing out the 10:40 departure (I didn't book that one because I wanted some time in Dubai, since I'm there already, and there just happened to be availability - of course, I checked first). Money-wise, having expenses is definitely important. However in a city of oil-millionaires/billionaires, my own funds could well be extinguished faster than I could imagine!

That's why I'm asking the gurus on SQTalk (and in the two months since I've joined officially, I have learnt a lot more than in the 2-years odd that I've lurked here, not to mention I've met some really wonderful and friendly people in real life). People say that guys hate asking for advice - something to do with their egos, but I'll be the first to say I'd rather be safe than sorry in a foreign land. Also, I am happily secure in my sexuality that I have no problems asking... hehe Seriously, I'd say this forum has some of the friendliest people I've ever met in an online community. I also actually help to admin one myself, and the community here sure is a whole-lot gentler, for which I am ever grateful! Click here to see what I mean (the 10th result on Google search). The forums on that site had a link/thread two years ago that caused me to stumble upon SQTalk in the first place... jhm: I will definitely ask - it may increase my chances of losing my luggage exponentially, though... I may just do some research on DXB / call up the airport to see if they have lockers large enough to store luggage suitable for my purposes whilst I run around. As for the Burj - well, I'm only there for a very short while, and to be honest, I was not thinking that Dubai would be one of my stopovers, more like I had no other alternatives in order to return to Asia... am sure you know what I mean ... since I am there anyway, $75 or even $100usd for an experience of a life-time seems a 'must-do' thing for me. I've probably spent more on even less trivial things. And I am sure it will add +100 reads on my TR after this crazy VIE DO is over! The High Tea at the Peninsula Hong Kong comes to mind... and their teensy cucumber sandwiches, heheh All the above was said in a good-hearted spirit, and I certainly do hope nobody takes it the wrong way also. I'm really a LOT better off in terms of knowing DXB than I was 24 hours ago, so I am happy to have asked. "
[BKK] Turkish Airlines Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15285-/page1," Living up to its reputation as a *A hub, our dear Suvarnabhumi has received a new addition to its lounge lineup. The TK lounge, which opened earlier this year, is conveniently located near D8 — well within reach of SQ loyalists. Being a standard *G lounge, regular admission rules apply. PP is also accepted here. It's right across the JL Sakura and around the corner from the BR lounge. An A330 model sits stop the front desk where you're greeted by the friendly lounge staff. Non-TK boarding passes are scanned and photocopied here. First impressions: it's a bright and pleasant-looking place with colour tones that are easy on the eye. Some comfy swivel armchairs by the windows give you the choice of looking out towards the bustling arrival pickup area or sit face-to-face with a companion. They're also the closest thing this place has to a dining-friendly seats. There were three locally-inspired hot items on offer, in addition to rice and congee. A modest selection of finger food, dessert and salad sits on the other side of the counter. The most unique feature of this lounge: the Turkish pizza station, which opens around 11am. It comes with a decent variety of accompaniments and sauces. "
[BKK] Turkish Airlines Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15285-/page1," The beverage selection is to the left of the pizza station, which also comes with Turkish tea and tea cups. Meanwhile, a manned bar is available nearby. The selection isn't particularly impressive, and the protruding wires of the TV really ruin the vibe. For last-minute business needs, a business centre is located to the left near the bathrooms. I stepped off a dreadful redeye which was TG-ed to a 773, and I was really looking forward to freshening up. Thankfully, this lounge does have a shower room that's located within the men's room. I can only assume the ladies' has one too. Amenities are by Euphoria Collection, though I can't say I've heard of this brand before this. They didn't include shower gel, which would be an issue as I'll explain in a bit. The shower itself is a straightforward experience. No fancy showerheads that spray from three different directions, just a run-of-the-mill shower with an external water heater. As far as *A showers go in BKK, this is probably the worst despite being the newest. The shower room is on the small side, there's no attached toilet (SKL Changi style), there wasn't any shower gel available as the dispensers were empty, the ceiling is quite low which might be a problem if you're above 6ft, the shower screen doesn't close properly making floods inevitable, and the only place to open your carry-on is on the floor. On the way out, I spotted a quiet area which might be useful for those trying to get some shut eye in between flights. It might not be a flat surface that the TG lounge offers, but it's certainly much quieter and darker. Overall, this lounge is a nice addition to the *A family in BKK. It's quiet in the day as the TK flights only depart in the evening, and might make for a more peaceful experience compared to the TG/SQ/BR lounges. Catering isn't its strong suit, and you'd be much better off taking a shower elsewhere, but for those seeking a quiet place to relax in for an hour or so, this place is a worth a visit. "

[SIN] Lounge choices at SIN?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5703-/page1," I have indeed experienced the SKL C Lounges in both T2 and T3, each once on a trip through SIN last month. I too found them excellent. In the case of the T2 Lounge, I came in at around 5am and had until 10.30 for my onward connection to KUL. The T2 lounge was a wonderful place to spend that time; there was little open at SIN at that time (though there were many places) and for someone used mostly to the UA RCCs in the US, the showers were a godsend! Given the selection and quality of food on the incoming SQ flight, I was not in need of any further significant amounts of food, yet there were plenty of fresh choices to nibble on. The T3 lounge on the way back was equally well appointed, and though busier at the times I was there, handled the amount of folk elegantly and, as was the case for the T2 lounge, was delightfully quiet! I can imagine they are hard to beat without going up to the Private Room or other First Class Lounges. "

[BKK] Question regarding TG lounges,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6004-/page1," Travelling TG C Class LHR-BKK-SYD and back at end of month... Am KF G with Sq.... Have a quick outbound (1.5 houors) stayover, but on way back, have 5 hours to kill.. would you guys reccomdend TG lounge or SKL ?? looking forward to hearing from you experts !! "
[BKK] Question regarding TG lounges,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6004-/page1," You have enough time to go lounge-hopping. For me, I have even managed to pop outside and go for a massage/dinner and come back to the airport in that timeframe (having a TG C BP ensures you'll have no problems fast-tracking through immigration). However if you do this you'll be liable for an extra 700 Thai Baht airport tax for going landside. Depending on the time of the day you're going and your personal preference, I'd recommend visiting the TG C lounge first (only snacks here), then visiting the SKL for more substantial food (use the free internet if you need to), then if you want, lounge-hop to other TG lounges perhaps for a shower to refresh yourself before finally heading for the Royal Orchid Spa for a complimentary 30 minute massage of head/neck or foot massage before heading for your departure gate. The views of the tarmac are generally the best from the spa. Enjoy BKK! "
[BKK] Question regarding TG lounges,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6004-/page1," What Kyo said. Five hours would be enough for me to head into town, definitely if the flight gets in earlier than that. But I do go through the city and the airport regularly so it makes it a bit easier I suppose. From the SKL you are only a few minutes away from the large main TG Business Lounge and also the two on either side of the C Pier. You turn right out of the SKL and go right again for the main TG lounge or straight on for the C pier ones. I use the C pier lounges regularly as they never seem to be too busy and have tarmac views. Food isn't up to much in them though, SKL is slightly better for that. "

Professional Excellence should not bring ""human arrogance"" in a service company and if it does, the company will cease to exist after all the loyalists make the company grow and in the case of SQ, the Business Class Customers are the major strength and this fades away or choose to fade away, then the reactions will be heavy.

Sit-down restaurant, plus a delicatessen and a sushi bar Extensive selection of cocktails Friendly, roving staff to take your drinks order and take it to where you're sitting (the bartender was aghast when I ordered a drink and asked her whether it would be OK for the drink to be taken to where I was planning to sit: ""Sir, I would have had someone come up to where you were and take your order so you wouldn't have to ask for it here!""

The lounge is the contract lounge for MI and SQ Business class and KFG passengers. It is also accessible by *G pax travelling on SQ flight only (not on MI). During check in, the agent will write a lounge invitation which has to be presented to the reception to access the lounge. The lounge is located after immigration and aviation security check, after the duty free shops and next to the food court. Interestingly the food court features the same eateries brands at the land-side before departure, eg. Burger King, Thai Express and The Coffee Club. Next to the reception is a small room with massage about 4-5 massage chairs which I lounge in (sorry no photos). This room is quite private and quite near to the buffet area. Sadly the massage chairs were not working and the chairs could not even be reclined as the panel buttons were missing. Food quality was average, enough to fill your stomach but wouldn't be considered any delicacy. Probably the food in the food court might have been better quality. General buffet line, on Flickr Hot food items, on Flickr Drinks area, on Flickr The lounge is actually quite huge with plenty of seating capacity. During the mid-day when I visited, the lounge was pretty empty. However, I have read that the lounge can get pretty packed during the late evening departure as that's when many airlines operating widebody aircraft schedule their flight to leave MLE. General lounge area, on Flickr Further into the lounge area, on Flickr At the end of the lounge, you can peer out of the window blinds to view the tarmac. On my visit, I spotted the Silk Air A320 which would bring me back to Singapore as well as an old and dirty Bangkok Airways A319 heading to BKK.

It was packed that afternoon and we initally picked the first two empty seats together that we saw.

On Friday night, the food spread was awesome - let me recall: -Beef short ribs (sweet) -Chicken (Reasonable portions with a capital R) -Fish (snapper of some sort iirc) -Duck (looks a little confit-like, without the confit... a little dry, but heck, duck on the menu, who's complainin') -Two indian dishes that I confess I paid little attention to -Better sushi than SKL T3, including unagi, salmon and tuna as well as the usual california rolls -Wintermelon, chicken + dates (or perhaps wolfberry, I forget) soup -Prawn fettucine -I think some noodles done Asian-style etc (*added: Sweet and sour pork, iirc...) Anyway, it was refreshing not to have to eat from the usual Sats menu and it closely mirrored the SKL T3 spread. Slight differences were: -Fish = basa at T3 -some Korean noodles thingy -Mostly the normal T3 SKL menu, the standard stuff I appreciate variety when it comes to food. Touch wood, I hope they keep up the food quality/variety. Now that I've done my good deed, the bad news: I don't appreciate not having *G showers nor having to go out and use the public toilet facilities. When asking the agent if she was sure, she did sound like she'd gotten used to telling people the same thing, that there really are no more showers. Stupid move, SQ. "

TPR access question,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13720-/page1," I've never had any issues entering the FCL when my onward flight is in J. You'll be fine as long as the agent is aware that your inbound flight was in F. The rules for TPR are less clear. I've never been turned away, but you might have to ask if the staff aren't proactive enough to escort you in. However, I wouldn't be TOO surprised if they insist that you need an onward F/R BP. "

A fellow passenger suggested I join him at the OZ lounge. To my disappointment, it was a wrong decision to do so. There was hardly anything worth eating - except for instant noodles in the OZ lounge. The single hot entree - sweet and sour something tasted like soggy cardboard. Next time round, the choice would be clear. Thankfully, I had a really delicious Korean style beef short rib on board that more than made up for the deficiency on the ground. "

Fast track for Heathrow arrivals is given onboard. You will be given one by the crew usually nearing the end of the flight. As for your sister, it's entirely at the discretion of the crew whether or not they want to give. Just ask nicely and see how they respond. Maybe they won't have enough etc. But you definitely need a physical card. A premium BP alone won't suffice. For T2 departures, no card or whatsoever. Just scan your BP at the gantry in the Fast Track lane and you should be admitted based on your registered credentials/class. You can't guest your sister. Anyway, there usually isn't much of a queue at departures as it's just security. It's the arrivals immigration and border screening that's a madhouse, also, depending on what time you arrive. "

Food is standard French-hotel-breakfast fare (breads and cold cuts, no hot food) but then again I am on the 1225hrs flight so they might have something more substantial in the later part of the day... Standard bar house-pours, wines, beer and soft drinks but no bubbly!! I guess on the flip-side they do have a brand of Sake to cater for the Japanese pax. There are showers available and the toilets are fairly clean (guess because this place is still new). There is also a quiet area for people to relax with lounging chairs (they have similar types in AMS ""quiet zones""). Overall a pretty decent place to relax but they could do with a better spread of food and of course some champers... "

If we should judge things from this perspective, probably neither a departure lounge should be needed. And similarly many other perks are not so essentials in many cases. Personally I think that a traveller paying for C/J or F fares (and i'm including also business trvlr whose ticket are paid by company) shouldn't get only an essential service but a dedicated one with some features which are not strictly necessary but can make your experience memorable.

If we should judge things from this perspective, probably neither a departure lounge should be needed. And similarly many other perks are not so essentials in many cases. Okay then. I would disagree with that idea, for the simple reason that the needs and requirements of a departure lounge are very different due to the fact that they are used by transfer passengers. Some transfer pax can be arriving on flights that are rather long (18 hours in the case of EWR for example, but there an awful lot of other long flights to and from Changi) and then connecting onto another flight, maybe up to another 8 or 9 if say they were going to AKL, to try and use this as an example. If you pay for a J or F ticket, and do a long trip with a transit at Changi, then you would rightly expect to be able to have a shower. However, my point that Changi didn't need an arrival lounge was because of how quick you can get to your hotel, or home in the case of residents. Why waste time in an arrival lounge if you could be in your Hotel room in virtually the same amount of time ?. I certainly wouldn't use an arrival lounge. Having said that, I do stay at the same Hotels, generally where I have status so I never have to wait for a room. My .02 $ "

Instant Noodles are in the box on the main Bar. You can also choose some snacks and hot food (the one i took is quite tasty). The cutlery is the first class one. Computers and workdesks are available in a separate room. (first class pens and writing kit are available as like as Silver kris lounge branded paper sheets).

Shanghai Airlines Lounge PVG Review,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8580-/page1," As the contract lounge for many many major airlines, LH, LX, SQ, Virgin etc. the Shanghai Airlines lounge at T2 PVG is a disgrace. Barely any food and only some drinks. One saving grace: you can get hot noodles from a little hole in the wall. When you come up the escalator, it's on your left. Not nearly enough to fill you up but at least it's warm. To be honest the only good thing about that lounge is that you have a place to sit and not have to congregate with everyone before the flight, and the lounge is usually quite close to your boarding gate. P.S. A little birdy told me that when SQ switched to T2, they weren't allowed to have their own lounge because of the MU deal falling through. Don't know how true that is but either way, very disappointing. "

For me, sleeping on a ship in high sea state is not the problem (as long as I'm not wet!), it's being upright! Anything more than sea state 5 or maybe 6 depending on the vessel, will probably kill me. And no reason therefore for SQ to have sleeping berths in its lounges when there are sleeping options ranging from budget (transit) to full hotel accommodations (CP). And given that most front-end pax would also be frequent guests of one hotel programme or the other, another reason to log a stay at a proper hotel like CP if you needed the shuteye. "

I have used VS metal a few times before and frankly was less than impressed. Whilst I appreciate they don't operate a F cabin, the VS C service on board is patchy at best, and shockingly bad at worst by comparison. A decent lounge on the ground doesn't make up for the fact that sometimes you think your flying ""Air Little Britain"" and certainly doesn't inspire me to consider flying them ever again. I had the misfortune some months ago in having to spend 4 hours in the SKL F. It was so boring that even my book, which had started off promising, got infected and became dull. I'm sure that most people who use it are *G hiding from the RCC lounge. SQ won't mind that I'm sure, afterall they can bill United. I'm sure that VS and SQ only did this because eligible pax would ever use the SKL in preference to the VSCH. But in doing so they have reduced the F experience further and at a time when premium cabins are hard to fill, maybe this wasn't the smartest move as there are heaps of other options on sectors that gateway through Asia.

I like them heaps comparatively speaking. Things to do and decent meals to be had in them. Check in is usually painless too, and everything seems to go so well right up to the point that you get on the plane. The food onboard can be terrible. I'm not a fussy guy but have refused two meals on the basis they were entirely inedible. The strange thing being that even the crew agreed with me and went foraging to find alternatives. Amenity kits are poor and have declined in the last few years. Although they still provide PJ's which are more comfy than SQ imo. The entertainment systems fine, the equipment is showing its age but does the job admirably, its more a case of the crew service being so much of a gamble. I just find the whole in flight crew experience to be like sitting in a nice seat in Y. Seriously though, its not that bad. It just a good product, its just let down a little by the crews and food from time to time. "

Is VS Clubhouse Access over??,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6426-/page3," I used the SKFL in LHR T3 this past weekend. Sure it's not a ""wonderlounge"" type a la VSCH. But I can't complain about the F&B offerings--the curried haddock with rice was actually better than the kedgeree served onboard in F (and ot: nobody makes kedgeree like my mom makes em ). Plus, with a total of only three of us using it at the time makes it feel just a tad more exclusive "
Is VS Clubhouse Access over??,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6426-/page3," Was there on Saturday and stepped both into the SKL and SAS Lounge. Like someone else said earlier, I think the SAS lounge is a little bit more interesting and lively. Both are a far cry from what VSCH offers ... real shame it's off limits now "

HND Suite lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/9768-/page1," I have not seen any thread on the lounge in the new International terminal. If I missed it, my apologies. It seems that NH has now renamed its F class lounges as ""Suite Lounges"". I noticed this a few days ago in NRT and today at HND. The Suite Lounge in HND is quite nice. It has a style with a lot more personality than the one in NRT. Heavy use of the black color but I must say that I like the setup. First a general view of the main seating area: View from the front row seats towards the entrance The food selection is much larger than at NRT: And there is a dining area: Pretty nice overall. "
HND Suite lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/9768-/page1, Funny discovery: Each seat has a pillow. The pillow is tied to the back of the seat so you can't take it to another seat!

[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," Some brief impressions here of the SQ SilverKris Lounge in Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3, from a visit in mid October 2019. This lounge is one level up from the main departure level, fairly close to the gates where SQ flights depart from. This lounge, first opened in July 2015, is fairly new, and is styled in SQ's ""Home Away from Home"" decor. There have been some very impressive SQ lounges done up in this new decor scheme, notably the new Bangkok SilverKris Lounge, which is one of my favourite SQ lounges. However, having the latest SQ design theme isn't a guarantee of a top lounge: the size and layout of the lounge matters as well. If you have a decent space, then the decor scheme works great. If not, well, then the results may be mixed. Before offering my views and opinions on this lounge, here is a quick tour... "
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," Entering the lounge, you first encounter a cosy seating area... ...which had some of SQ's signature design elements, such as high-backed chairs... There was a large table which was used both for dining and work... The main seating area was a long, rectangular space... I found this section of the lounge a little utilitarian, however at least there were windows with tarmac and runway views. At the far end, several work cubicles, also in SQ's signature stying... Overall, the seating area was ok, but not particularly inspired, perhaps even a little boring, compared to the cutting edge designs that SQ's competition often has in their lounges. "
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," There was a decent buffet spread in the dining area... Local San Miguel beer on tap... Red and white wines... A fairly basic liquor selection... There was a signature cocktail, Manila Dawn, prepared on demand by the lounge staff... I could not resist ordering one... An unusual cocktail, with a sweet, creamy and milky flavour, which I quite enjoyed. "
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1, Salads at the buffet... Samosas and chicken tandoori wraps... Nachos... Sandwiches and fresh fruit... 
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," The hot selections were good as well... Won ton mee, already portioned out into bowls -- all you needed to do was to fill the bowl with soup from a nearby pot. Creamy fusili pasta... Japanese Beef curry... ...and white rice... A very decent buffet spread... "
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1, There was a magazine/newspaper rack with regional newpapers and magazines. There was also a toilet inside the lounge (Although there were no showers). There was also a Krisshop showcase... ...which included items including these Hello Kitty cabin crew... 
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," As there are multiple SQ flights out of MNL each day, the lounge alternates between peak busy periods and lull periods. I thought the lounge staff did a great job tidying the lounge and refilling the food in between lounge peak periods, where the number of pax in the lounge would grow as time to depart approached, then completely empty out when boarding commenced. The picture below shows the lounge at almost peak capacity, prior to an afternoon flight out of Manila. At least the day I was there, the lounge was busy at peak hours, but not completely packed. "
[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," Overall impressions of the lounge: Positives - Good food - Decent drink selection, including a very tasty signature cocktail - Warm and friendly lounge staff - Ample power outlets and charging points - Close to the SQ gates - Runway views Negatives - Lounge shape not ideal: Long rectangular seating area detracted from overall ambience. - Not a particularly large lounge: Can get busy at peak hours Overall I thought the SQ SilverKris Lounge in Mania was a decent place to spend time before a flight, although the awkward long rectangular shape, and smallish space, meant that there was only so much SQ could do to make the lounge more distinctive or attractive, decor-wise. Lounge space and layout limitations probably meant that compromises were made in designing the lounge. I still see BKK as the SQ regional lounge that sets the standard that other SQ lounges should aspire to. "

[MNL] SilverKris Lounge in Manila Airport T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15381-/page1," I like the lounge, when it's not so busy......window seats can get quite warm but have a nice view. Nachos and draft beer, what's not there to like? Never tried making my own noodle, always scared I get it wrong but the sandwiches are never that great so it might be an option to get right next time. "

Big changes coming to SKL / TPR / KF G at T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15196-/page2," Well overdue for an overhaul of all the Silverkris lounges at SIN. T2 also, not just T3. Food at F class is often not as good as the J class lounge, ironically, especially at non-peak times like midday. The food at the F class lounge just doesnt turn over quickly at those times, so its not as fresh. And there often more choice at the J class lounges. And TPR can be even worse. The food comes 2-3 minutes after ordering, so they are just microwaving food thats already been cooked. Thats a pretty low standard.

Originally posted by Short Final View Post Well overdue for an overhaul of all the Silverkris lounges at SIN. T2 also, not just T3. Food at F class is often not as good as the J class lounge, ironically, especially at non-peak times like midday. The food at the F class lounge just doesnt turn over quickly at those times, so its not as fresh. And there often more choice at the J class lounges. And TPR can be even worse. The food comes 2-3 minutes after ordering, so they are just microwaving food thats already been cooked. Thats a pretty low standard. Many other airlines have awesome F lounges with real dining experience, and for the TPR, that should be the reference point. More than once, Ive left the TPR to go get fresher and tastier food at the J lounge. Agree with all that. All the lounges have fallen behind : T2 SKL J & F, T3 SKL J & F and definitely TPR, which is the flagship lounge of an airlines that likes to consider itself right up there is just not good enough in this day and age.

None of the lounges I’ve been to from London to Australia gave me a feeling of home except for a few food dishes ( which were pretty good like the nasi lemak and laksa in LHR F) Unless SQ replaces the tables and chairs with wooden stools / benches and marble top tables with the lounge dragons screaming kopi.... at the top of their lungs I’d hardly see any resemblance of home. It all western influence design. Even the coffee is “ang moh” type

Cathay Pacific went for a residential theme for their lounges as well, which has been executed and rolled out more successfully than SQ. London-based Studioilse has transformed a corner of Hong Kongs international airport into a new 2,000 sq metre first class lounge for Cathay Pacific. Before we designed a single thing we started questioning what luxury really means to first class travellers today, says Studioilse founder Ilse Crawford. We spent a lot of time in lounges watching and talking with people. It was riveting. The result is a world away from the typical corporate lounge aesthetic to a space more akin to an elegant apartment, except in this one, the living room, library and dining room comes with a well-being area, signature fragrance and curated music. https://www.wallpaper.com/travel/stu...tional-airport "

You can read about it here... "
New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page3," I'm in the T2B United Club at the moment, waiting for SQ319. The check-in agent who checked me in said he believed that the new SKL should be open before Christmas. That being said, he also admitted that SQ's previous two announcements were that the lounge was opening at the end of October, then again at the end of November, so it's hard to say when the new lounge will be opening. SQ has lounge arrangements with the Plaza Premium Lounge in T2A. They seem to targeting this arrangement primarily to passengers flying in SQ317/SQ305. Passengers flying in SQ319/SQ321 are mostly suggested to go the the United Club or to the Maple Leaf Lounge. Passengers in Suites/First can also go to the United Global First Lounge. I made quick visits to the LH Senator Lounge, the AC Maple Leaf Lounge and the United Club. The United Club seems to be the largest, while the Maple Leaf Lounge is the smallest. Food seems to be the best at the Senator Lounge, which is catered by Do&Co. However, the Senator Lounge also seems to be the busiest (at least at this time). This might be because the LH Lounge is in T2A, where most of the short-haul gates are, and hence where most of the passenger traffic is. The United Club and the Maple Leaf lounge were both fairly quiet when I visited, though the AC Lounge seems to be cosier. No photos, unfortunately: I take terrible ones that wouldn't be worth posting online. "
New SKL in LHR T2,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12680-/page3," The UA Global First Lounge closes at 6pm making it less than useful for Suites pax on the SQ321. The F alternative would be the LH Senator lounge I guess, but that's a long walk from the gate, so effectively if you're in Suites on the late flight you have UA Club or AC options (UA is the better one).

Even in T2 last week similar experience. I don't get it.. compared to all other SQ staff they are so not with the program.

When we walked up the ZRH SEN/SWISS Lounges ladies at the front desk, she scanned our boarding passes and my Gold Card. She told me that she can't let my friend in to which I replied ""well, isn't she departing on a Star Alliance flight and don't I have the right to invite a guest to the lounge?"" to which she replied ""no, you don't!"". I was like ""I am sorry to bother you but you must be mistaken: Star Alliance policy never stood in my way to bring a guest heading to another destination to all the other lounges I've been to and could I have any higher status on intra-Euro than *G plus flying paid Business Class except HON Circle?"" ... she replied ""Well, okay, I will make an exception"" and showed us to the normal SWISS Lounges instead of the SEN Lounges which we would have been entitled to enter. I did not want to fight with her because I only wanted my cup of coffee in the lounge and some time to talk to my friend ... but this kinda annoyed me. I do this all the time: boosting total strangers to the VIE lounges ... why don't the folks at SWISS read their manuals? "

They Really Are Dragons,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5537-/page1, I now make sure that I carry my relevant card when accessing a lounge through status as I have been asked to show my card on so many ocassions with so many different airlines. With BA at LHR it is a must as the status on your boarding pass could be out of date. When showing my relevant card I have never had a problem. The only time I have had a problem was trying to bring a guest into the SKL when travelling F. They were refusing access for a guest. I asked them to go and check the access rules. The lady went away and came back and said this time she would bend the rules and allow me guest. I still said not good enough I want you to acknowledge that I am allowed a guest. She finally admitted that I was allowed a guest. A couple of days later I was back in the SKL travelling LH in F even though the lounge was much fuller they were very happy to allow me two guests (Maybe because they could charge LH). Even though I have had a few problems I would say I have never met a lounge dragon as they have always been very polite and friendly (just not always very well informed). 
Sydney SKL lounge guest access,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4049-/page1," Hi With all the changes to lounge privileges, just wondering if I can take a guest flying Air China Y on the same day into the SKL lounge?

[SIN T3] Krisflyer Gold Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3055-/page2, The thing that gets me is that the toilets are not actually in the lounge.

Big changes coming to SKL / TPR / KF G at T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15196-/page5," Originally posted by Airtropolis View Post I guess its a combination of factors: 1) Loads in the premium cabins are indeed up. 2) The Silver Kris lounge now has to accomodate Stargolds; Business Class pax from Partner airlines as well as First Class pax in what is essentially only the Business class lounge. 3) More worrisome though - SQ's operations used to be divided between T2 and T3 with a separate Silver Kris lounge complex, serving each terminal, so its likely a capacity decrease (even more so if you read this article - https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/bru...remium-lounges, which says that though the upcoming T3 SK Lounge complex is larger in size by 30% compared to the former and can accomodate over 1000pax at a go ... the same article states that the current Qantas First + Business class lounges can accomodate 800 over pax ... which for a non Singapore based carrier is generous especially compared to the 1000+ pax capacity of the upcoming SK Lounges in T3 in total!) The above illustrates how limited in capacity the upcoming SK lounges actually are - unless there are plans for another SK Lounge complex in T2 or maybe even T1... now that SQ's operations are divided in these two terminals. SQ passenger capacity is already up to nearly 50% of pre-COVID times so it shouldn't be too much longer before they branch back out to T2, which is currently still closed. This will take some burden off this new lounge. Secondly, *G entry for those flying in the tail is temporary until a new KF Lounge is ready but 9V-JKL's report says that's still a year away, if completed on time. *G flying Premium/Economy is a large number, especially regionally. It's busier than I expected for current traffic and it won't get better anytime soon, actually getting worse as passenger loads continue to improve. The first change to help, is whether there is a schedule to open T2 but really, SQ don't care about whether the lounge is busy if they can save costs by currently consolidating in a single terminal. SQ have a deal with other lounger to share space - when I headed to Europe back in November, SQ already signed me into the SATS lounge next door as the temp SQ lounge was already packed....... this, then meant SATS lounge was also already super busy.

The invitation has a date written on it and that's the day of your First/Suites flight. You don't need the invitation to get into the TPR as it's more a symbolic gesture and you can get access by just showing your boarding pass as well. The only thing that sets the TPR apart from the FCL is the fact that you can do a a la carte dinner. That's very limited and boring in the morning. If you want to 'experience' the TPR, you are better of on a night flight. "

[LHR T1] Which *A Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6947-/page1," I enjoyed BMI's No. 1 Heathrow the most, very stylish and relaxing atomsphere I thought. Runway views is a bonus. It's a bit of walk in the dreadful lay-out of what is after all Heathrow T1, despite the recent facelift. Poor food selection when I was there early morning, only cereal, toast and pastries. Check out some of the pictures on BMI site: http://www.flybmi.com/bmi/en-gb/the-...-heathrow.aspx Slumberettes, showers and computers available. The Star Alliance lounge was ok, but very crowded in my experience as all the *A carriers try to send their pax to this one. Better breakfast in *A lounge, I liked the bacon rolls. Oh, and there are no views at all here, feels a bit like a bunker (even though it's not under ground). Lounge is easy to find, and probably closer to your gate than BMI. Your C boarding pass will get you into both, though the SAA check-in will probably issue *A lounge invite. Enjoy! "

LAX or SFO immigration, it really depends on personal matters. I know I always have a hard time going through SFO because of my passport. But, yes, SFO is less hectic than LAX. Flying AC to YVR, of course lounge-wise, LAX is preferable because I like NZ Lounge at T2 there. In short, for the whole trip, with the variables you mention so far, I would do ICN-SFO for the comfort of New SQ C which make the whole trip more pleasant. "
SFO lounge question,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/2651-/page1," Just as an update, I am confirmed on SQ 16 arriving in SFO at 11.05am, connecting to SQ 1046 (operated by AC) at 8.10pm to YVR. I was able to get a day room at the Hyatt Regency SFO for $ 109.00 for a regular room or $ 139.00 with bayview, which I really appreciate, so I can rest and don't spend the night but still get home the same day. If anyone is interested the dayroom is bookable from 10.00am to 6.00pm. I checked also with STARWOOD but they had no hotels in the area that would book dayrooms. Thanks for everyones help and info. Looking forward to my first more then 6 hour flight in the new business class seat, though that seems to be out now and the A380 is in. "

No time to travel around during the last weeks, busy working and now finding some time to idle in this lounge, thought I post some pictures and do some posting for all. This lounge is typical Scandinavian design, just like what you see walking into a Ikea store. Plenty of pine wood high chairs, table tops, and blue cushion sofas. There is free wifi, so folks, you can log in and surf away while sitting in this lounge, in fact, it was free wifi at LHR SAS lounge when I was there 3 days ago. Ok... let of the talk more of the pictures.... was actually waiting for them to be uploaded, these are fresh from the oven....

Very personal and everyone greeted by name once I got in which was kinda nice. Has a dining area with interesting seats - a la carte as well as small buffet. Has 2 computers near the back area and the rest large chairs and 2 super HUGE flatscreens. I feel it's still behind Thai's 1st class lounge. I am most probably wrong but it feels like SQ keeps innovating with things like the suites (after the 777er 1st class product) and now this lounge because the first attempt didn't really hit the mark. Even this attempt I feel has missed another opportunity to be an innovator and place their ground product above and beyond their competition. Just my thoughts ... thanks

Based on what I was told by the lounge agent, only F/R passengers paying by cash are eligible. Somehow they manage to differentiate by printing ""you're invited to the private room"" vs ""you're invited to SKL"" on the BP. Yes there is a separate dinning area. In fact there's an A la carte menu. The menu I got was for breakfast. I was told there would be another set of menu after 10am. And yes tarmac. BTW I believe that was the best seat for tarmac view. "

Was in a rush so didn't really have much time to explore. I actually did ask the opinion of a lounge agent regarding excluding TPPs and those travelling with a mile-upgraded F BP from TPR, and guess what answer did I receive? ""Exclusivity""! In fact, I only saw two other pax in TPR this morning. It was indeed exlusive as when I first entered, I was escorted by 6 lounge agents who came one after another asking if I would like to order anything to drink/eat or simply asking me to get comfortable. Talking abt God-like treatment! It was to the extent that I actually felt a bit embarrassed with so many ppl trying to serve me TPR is not open 24 hrs. Think the opening hrs should be roughly the same as that of the FCL check-in lounge. We all know that F SKL at T3 is not good for pax who wish to sleep overnight. Do expect to get a bit disappointed if you're looking for some sleeping areas in TPR - I didn't see any. BTW I was told by the lounge agent the reason they didn't include such sleeping areas was due to the ""fact that most passengers only spend a short time in the lounge, without staying overnight"". "

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page5," Although we talk on SQT about lounges more than most people , I think we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that The Private Room is a lounge and - at the end of the day - like all lounges, simply a glorified waiting room for a journey from A to B. Most non-transit passengers don't (like some of us on here) arrive at the lounge hours and hours in advance. For most, it's a wait of an hour or so with the opportunity to grab a drink (which doesn't mean how many bottles to get through ), catch up on e-mails etc. For those who actually have a long layover, Changi Airport has plenty to keep anyone amused; and if you have an overnight, the place to stay (even if some of us don't do so) is really a hotel rather than the lounge itself. TPR is no doubt fit for purpose but it's not (nor meant to be) a life changing experience and we should align our expectations accordingly. "

Assuming you're travelling in economy, your standard blue KrisFlyer card won't get you into the SQ lounge (called the Silver Kris Lounge (""SKL"")). You can't pay to upgrade your KrisFlyer membership nor can you pay to enter the SKL. However, you can pay to enter the lounges which nykelaz mentions above. It's inexpensive and you can get a shower, sit down, free soft drinks etc. You may also want to check out the other facilities available at Changi airport, e.g. the free city tour for transit passengers like yourself: http://www.visitsingapore.com/publis...__transit.html Hope this helps!

At check-in, I was invited to one of the two lounges. I was given a pc of paper reminding me the time it takes to get to my gate (20 -40 min) and if I use the Swiss Business Lounge, to take this into consideration. As the Swiss Business Lounge was immediately to the right on entry into the transit area, I headed there first. At the Swiss Business Lounge, I was informed that I can ONLY use one of the two lounges (this or the Panorama). I decided to stay and they stamped onto my boarding pass that I have used my entitlement. The Swiss Business Lounge is also BEFORE passport check although that was not an issue to clear within a couple of minutes. As what MAN Flyer and Desert Traveller said, one needs to take the train to the boarding gate and that takes about 20min end-to-end. And the A380 does board quite early and you do get better champagne on-board. Sorry - I have no pictures to share as I had only 10min there that I used to change out of my warm clothings at the loo apart from a quick look-around. Verdict - don't bother with either. If I was not short of time, I may enjoy a hot chocolate at Springli instead. Proabably more enjoyable. "

Ultimately people who redeem first class tickets must have flown tons of miles before they could do that. Why begrudge them the use of the private room? SIA has changed, and not for the better. While other airlines are introducing things like spas and arrival lounges to their premium products, SIA is eagerly underlining the EPS and shareholder dividends on their annual reports. While other airlines grant lounge access to even the most basic of frequent flyer tiers, SIA guards their lounges like they're fort knox. This is no way to treat the customers who have been loyal to you over so many years, even when other airlines offered cheaper (And arguably even better service) airfares. That being said, I'm probably just jealous I'll never get to go in. "
[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page17," Originally posted by mad max View Post sorry to flog a dead horse, but it's ridiculous that SIA thinks they can get away with segregating even further their premium passengers. Ultimately people who redeem first class tickets must have flown tons of miles before they could do that. Why begrudge them the use of the private room? This is not necessarily true, the F seat may come from FFP miles earned through tons of credit card points etc. Having said that, differentiating redemption F pax from the paid F pax for lounge access purpose is not very nice IMHO.

My flight to ZRH is LH J. Your thoughts appreciated. Alby If you aren't Star Gold, then you will be directed towards the Business Lounge at A26 - I usually refer to it as the slum. If you are Star Gold, you will be directed towards the Senator Lounge at A26 - which is just overcrowded. I think there's a shower at A26. Essentially - LH J onward gets you the Business Lounges which offer you tea, coffee, soft drinks, beer machines and cheap wine and liquor. There is some very limited food (bread and croissants and quark for breakfast, consommme and bread and maybe wurst). They are basically somewhere to sit (and FRA A26 is the exception to the rule in being an overcrowded slum). If you have Star Gold status, you can access the Senator lounges, which have a better food and drink selection. You may find it easier to access the non-Schengen lounges in B if you arrive their. Whilst the meagre offerings are the same, they are much less crowded - although there can be queues for the showers. The shower attendants don't often speak English, btw. The problem with using B non-Schengen is you may well have to pass through security twice, once to use them and once to go from B to A. It depends which crazy setup in the FRA terminal 1 maze they have this week. If you are on LH3720, go straight through immigration to connect and use A26. If you are on LH3722 you have time to use the better B-lounges. The best option is actually the Welcome Lounge, but that's supposed to be only for LH pax terminating in Frankfurt, however it has been used by people connecting before now. However, I've not used it myself and the FRA lounge wardens are very much of the ""Befehl ist Befehl"" school. If you can alter your ticket to SIN-MUC-ZRH - I recommend it. "

The best thing to be said for them is they are all shiny and new and they are even quite large - even with FRA in Hell mode like today, there were seats. The worst thing is most of the furniture appears to have come from old stock from the former DDR. They both have showers, two of them. There will be something that LH will tell you is breakfast - it isn't. The food offerings will be better in the SEN lounge.

Especially after putting into considering that SQ has so many flights there, wouldn't running a SKL there actually be cost effective? "

HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page4," [HKG] SQ SilverKris Lounge in Hong Kong SQ has 7 flights a day to Hong Kong, including SQ1/2, which stops in HKG enroute to SFO. With all this traffic going through Hong Kong, does this lounge live up to passenger's expectations of SQ? How does the SilverKris Lounge compare with other lounges there? HKG is Cathay Pacific's home base, and CX has several superb lounges there. The QF Lounge in HKG is impressive as well. SQ has recently remodelled the HKG SilverKris Lounge. While it occupies the same windowless space as before, the interior has been completely redesigned, and new features added, including a full service bar, and shower / bathroom facilities. One of the first things a visitor to the lounge sees is the new full service bar. The drinks menu in July. The lounge has spacious seating areas styled based on SQ's latest lounge theme. Self-contained work/lounging stations towards the back of the lounge seating area. "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page4," There is a self service F&B buffet area with hot and cold selections. I visited the lounge on two occasions, in late May and early July this year. For my July visit, I visited the lounge just as they were changing from the breakfast menu to the lunch menu, and so managed to snap pics of both meal services. Some of the breakfast selections... Beef congee with traditional condiments... Stir-fried noodles... Chee Cheong Fun... Siew Mai... Lotus leaf rice... Sausages and scrambled eggs... There were pastry items for breakfast, and they were just refilling the warmers with quiche as a daytime snack... Catering change-over to the lunch menu... Two soups, one Asian and one western... "

For those who miss their NS night snack days, they also had red bean soup with coconut milk as the Asian dessert selection... There is also a small freezer stacked full of Haagen Daz...

HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page4," Overall impressions? On the positive side, I found the F&B to be very good, and the fact that they now have bathrooms/showers to be a big plus. In terms of seating and lounging, this is decent, and the lounge did not fill up when I was there, so it was quite comfortable. The decor is very much the latest SQ house style for the lounge, and whether that appeals to you is very much a matter of personal taste. The fact that it was a windowless room still meant that I much preferred walking around outside the airy terminal, rather than spend too much time sitting in the lounge. How does it compare with the competition in HKG? Well, competition in HKG is fierce. So while the SQ lounge is a perfectly decent lounge overall, with very good catering, it is to some extent shown up by the competition. The CX lounges remain superb. No contest there. The difference is night and day in CX's favour. I also prefer the QF lounge. Even the UA/Star Alliance lounge at the other end of the terminal has a more open and airy feel, although F&B options in the UA lounge are quite limited. All that said, if you need a quick pit stop in transit on SQ1/2, or need to grab a quick bite or a drink before your flight, then the SQ lounge is fine. I for one normally just go in for a few minutes for a drink or snack, maybe to use the bathroom/shower, then head outside again where the terminal itself has a lot more to see and do than in the lounge.

I am not trying to say that your family were screaming at the staff. that statement should be taken in general context. many of us decided to vent our anger at the counter staff or the customer service staff who picked up the call. Originally posted by motodave View Post As to the comment, how did the staff know why wife is a member for 22 years, she showed the women the card, in the lower middle it states years qualified 22 years. Why would I have to contact senior staff for an exception to the lounge, are you telling me that lounge staff have no distraction, and if they allow one extra person in they will be fired, are the rules that strict with SQ, about giving away a lounge access, if that is the case they have a lot more problems than a website . Weather they will get fired or not by allowing extra person to go into the lounger, I do not know as I do not work for SIA. But for sure, he/she may need to explain why. I think the reason they applied that strict policy is because of this article below http://upgrd.com/matthew/singapore-a...is-lounge.html I found it at search engine dated Jan-2011. motodave, I fully understand your displeasure. If I were in your position I think I will also feel very upset like you. My suggestion lodge a formal complain to SIA and see how they react. To be very frank, they just simply act by the book. But I know where you come from. They should have show a little more concern and show some attitude that they are willing to assist and accomodate for a loyal customers like you. "
Lounge Access Question,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/9664-/page2," I believe it is reasonable to expect SQ to *once in a long while*, exceptionally allow additional guest into the lounge with Q/TPP member (perhaps it is best to pre-arrange with the local SQ office to avoid disappointment?). Without pre-arrangement, how would a lounge agent know if a Q/TPP member regularly abuse this rule (regularly bring extra passenger)? That would be unfair to other members as well. "
Lounge Access Question,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/9664-/page2," motodave, I understand your frustrations but the rules are there and it's not just SQ that enforces it. Other carriers will enforce it regardless even with their highest tiers unless prearranged. You mentioned that you managed to bring your daughter into a lounge 15 years ago. She was 5 then, you can't possibly let a kid wander around the airport unattended. Of course they would have allowed entry. Fast forward to the present, your daughter should be at least 20 - effectively a young adult. That would constitute 2 adults guests rather than just 1. At least SQ still allows guests even in whY for it's top tier. EK has already limited guesting for its Golds just to those in F/J and it's only 1 guest. From experience with QF as long as the family has kids are who are minors, the lounge agent will have some discretion. LH does have more leeway with their top tier HON but it's still one guest + spouse/partner with kids under 18. Even if SQ had this policy, your wife, MIL & daughter wouldn't be able to access the lounge either way. "

I am not able to follow you: Silverkris Lounge: This is (still) a very good lounge offering for any business class lounge: nice design, good food offering, generous alcohol and beverages First Class Lounge: I think this upgraded offering is targeted at Solitaire not flying First Class and I don't see why SQ should penalize that group of customers. The Private Room: The champagne offered here is massively better than what CX gives you in the Pier and Wing (SQ currently offers Blanc des Millénaires 1995  Champagne Charles Heidsieck; CX is offering Peninsula or Moet). *G: SQ is doing the right thing by having an 'exclusive' *G Lounge and keep those people out of the Silverkris Lounge.

Reply to your opinion: SKL: Desperately needs a renovation, T3 one didn't renovated from 2008, needs a new one-class SKL design that combines SKL F and J before 2018. It's far away from J only competitor (QR/UA), not even close to medium-grade cardholder lounge (multiple CX/QF). SKL F: Not much difference to SKL, just a more exclusive area, I think SKL will be a one-class premium lounge after renovation. Some extra services will be provided to *A F pax/Solitaire PPS (like Qantas in SIN/HKG/BNE/PER). The Private Room: Where I'm taking about, it desperately needs a renovation, it was leading F lounge back in 2008 (even claimed revenue F pax only back then, not even mile F pax), if The Private Room continue to be SQ F pax only, they should offer a choice of Dom and Krug, like onboard SQ. In today, it's far away from its F only competitor (QR/AF), not even close to top-grade cardholder lounge (CX/QF/EY/LH/LX). *G KFGL: SATS can open another lounge that contract SQ and other *G traveling on *A here or SQ will renovate KFGL with less food and beverage option. "
The Private Room (and the whole T3 SKL) needs renovating,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14522-/page1," I fail to see why the Silverkris Lounge is not a very good lounge just because they are not aligned to the new design concept that's featured in Sydney or London [it's questionable why they don't feature the design in their hub but the lounge offering is definitely better than UA]. The Private Room today offers top notch champagne on the level with Krug and Dom (Blanc des Millénaires 1995  Champagne Charles Heidsieck). The Private Room has never been a top notch lounge and needs a complete redesign. First Class Lounge: Even in cities where the new design ""connects"" F and J lounge, there are still two different areas with different access rights. The F lounge will always stay. SQ will always run their own *G Lounge as this is a good source of income and hence will not defer to SATS. "
The Private Room (and the whole T3 SKL) needs renovating,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14522-/page1," I don't get all the hate for the homebase SKL (and TPR). I like classy decor, and the abundance of food and beverages. Maybe it's just that most people get bored after a few years and would expect that airlines should give their lounges a makeover. Or maybe it's that while the lounge has all the facilities and amenities expected of it, it doesn't have a unique selling point (CX's bar in The Pier, or EY's massage services). For that I always felt SQ could leverage on what Changi does so well- indoor gardens. A large indoor garden would really brighten up the place and add to the ambiance, maybe with some fragrant plants for a sensory boost. Something of a ""tropical paradise"" theme of sorts. That would definitely stand out. "

The KFL has a poor choice of food and I've questioned quality on the odd occasion I decided to go in. I much prefer DNATA's lounge just a few feet away - they do a far superior job in food and beverage, have separate eating and lounging areas plus have showers. I have colleagues traveling in from Europe, and it's quite a poor image for them to compare what they get at home and what the equivalent is here. I get better lounge service in Europe and elsewhere in Asia than I do at ""home"".......""Thank you for your loyalty."" Wouldn't be so bad but flying out of Singapore on SQ is crazy expensive in comparison to SQ tickets purchased just about everywhere else, to here. Having said that, the SKL is good, and very good in comparison to the KFL but it does need a bit of maintenance. I prefer other locations, but T3's is still a good choice. "

[KIX] SQ Contract Lounge in Kansai Airport: JAL Sakura Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13938-/page1," A bit of a surprise when I checked in for my KIX-SIN flight on SQ. While SQ uses Star Alliance partner ANA's Lounge in Narita (And Haneda as well, I believe), at KIX, the designated SQ lounge is the JAL Sakura Lounge. This is probably because the ANA Lounge is in the North Wing of KIX, whereas SQ departs from the South Wing at the other end of KIX, where the JAL Sakura Lounge is. For me, this was a pleasant surprise, because while the ANA lounges are good, I have always liked the JAL lounges in NRT and HND, both for the ambience as well as the catering -- I love JAL's signature beef curry which they serve in their lounges. As Krisflyer / Star Gold, I was entitled to entry for myself and one guest. (Like other Star or SQ lounges, no exceptions were granted for accompanying children. Only two pax allowed in: member + guest). "

As my wife and I had already enjoyed a really good breakfast at the Hilton Osaka before taking the limo bus to KIX, we didn't go to the lounge. Truthfully though, we got caught up with last-minute shopping at the various duty-free outlets. The voucher includes options to Sakura: Tully's Coffee, Ganko (Japanese food/sushi), and Pronto (coffee and snacks). The voucher lets you order up to 2,000 yen worth of food at these alternative places. Great if you want a really good cup of robust coffee versus the diluted Japanese coffee, I think. Genko and Pronto is in the main section of the terminal just after immigration before one takes the monorail to the satellite terminal where Sakura lounge is and where SQ's gate is normally (gate 41?), while Tully's is near the boarding gate.

SIA still uses gate 41 and the Sakura lounge between gates 37 and 38 in the satellite terminal. We also received the JPY 2,000 voucher, which we used to get entry to the lounge. The lounge itself still looks exactly the same as posted by yflyer in 2015 and the curry is still delicious. However, for the late afternoon flight, the lounge got at times rather crowded. There were many mainland Chinese pax departing on several Chinese airlines around the same time as SQ621. "
TBIT StarAlliance Lounge Opened on July 24,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/1714-/page1," *A lounge in TBIT finally opened today. It is a vast improvement from the old lounges or the interim lounge, although that's not saying much. There are four new lounges, Star Alliance, One World, Skyteam and LAX International (shared), each take up half a floor. Only the Stat Alliance lounge is open today, others are still being finished. They are on the 4th and 5th floor after security. Some nice features: 1) Modern decor, just like the web site photo. 2) 8 new shower rooms . 3) Free fast wired and wireless internet . 4) Much larger than the old lounges with open view of runway. Some letdowns: 1) Washrooms are the refurbished old ones. They are brand new but small as before. I don't understand why they built 8 new shower rooms without adding washroom space. 2) The overall lounge area is still relatively small. It may get pretty crowded during busy hours. 3) F&B is limited. In fact, it is not much better than the interim lounge. 4) SQ no longer allows *G and PPS members to use first class section for this lounge since it is a contracted lounge. Only passengers flying First Class get to use the first class section. I guess SQ wants to weed out cheapskates like me who never pay for First Class. No photos, sorry! I forgot to bring my camera. "

TSA has nothing on these people. AT LEAST 500 pax from various arriving flights were expected to pass thru ONE x-ray scanner to get thru transit security back to the departure level.

Nothing worse than a long day working and travelling, with a longhaul overnight flight ahead and straight to work on arrival when there is no shower. As a result I usually end up going to the domestic lounge in AKL to nab a shower, but this takes up a lot of time and relies on bending of the rules. "

I agree with that. Bearing in mind the removal of the flight screens was supposedly to 'further personalise' TPR experience it's something that should have thought about if they are looking to do that, especially as they make such a fuss over doing it on board. I am reminded of a flight home to MAN with my brother in F a few years ago (on SQ328 when it was via MUC) with us sat in 1C & D. He was stunned that even though our glasses were literally inches apart the LSS filled his up first then walked all the way around through the galley around to me to fill mine. He tried his best to persuade her to just lean over and ill it but I told him that's they way they are trained so she won't, and she didn't. Maybe they should have crew working in TPR.

[EWR] Denied entry to VS Clubhouse in Newark while on VS flight,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5934-/page1," Hi everyone, being too lazy to write into VS to demand why I was denied entry to CH at EWR last year I thought i'd ask here if i was in the wrong. I have never had trouble gaining access to a VS clubhouse in an economy flight on Virgin using my PPS Solitaire card until this recent experience last year. I was flying from EWR-LHR on Virgin economy and then onwards to SIN on SQ in C not that the second leg matters. I was reluctantly checked in at the UC counter by a staff member who said next time I should use the Y checkin and then proceeded to rip my Upper Class tags off my bag that the LHR staff had very kindly tagged. I'm pretty sure priority checkin and baggage is a solitaire benefit on Virgin according to our membership guide but this checkin agent thought differently and told me that no i dont have any benefits other than being able to credit my miles to SQ. I usually dont mind waiting for my bags but I was on the VS morning flight that reaches heathrow around 8:25pm and I had to recheck my bags for the LHR-SIN flight at 10:05pm so the connection was somewhat tight. I then proceeded to go to the Clubhouse lounge in what i think was concourse C. The station manager who I talked to was quite polite but very insistent that I did not have any CH access. When insisting that I had gained clubhouse access while flying Y in HKG, NRT, LHR, and even JFK she said that LHR was just an outlier in the system because maybe they had a large lounge but that she has not been informed that any SQ frequent fliers were able to access CH and said that JFK probably should not have granted me access!!!!! on a previous trip!!!! She said that she remember before 2005 they had some agreement with SQ but that this has long been rescinded!!!! She nonetheless gave me her business card if i wanted to write in to virgin for a reply and encouraged me to join VS's flying club which would grant me access, which i thought was handled well. I therefore retreated in defeat to the McDonalds Newark airport for breakfast which i must say makes a really bad coffee IMHO and charged $3 for a packet for a very unfresh fruit salad. Access to CH would definitely be appreciated in an airport like EWR which is quite dour. Have any SQTalkers run into similar problems with EWR CH? Can EWR CH be accessed when flying SQ 21 nonstop to SIN as CH can be accessed flying SQ? Thanks just wanted to clarify whether EWR lounge might be specifically prohibited to SQ staff as this is a problem that happens more with airlines like UA than VS. "
[EWR] Denied entry to VS Clubhouse in Newark while on VS flight,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/5934-/page1," I could be wrong but I don't think it's a QPP or TPP benefit to have access to the VS CH (nor any other benefits such as UC check-in and security) when flying on VS in Y. If I'm correct, the times you were let in before appear to be out of goodwill on VS's part. Edit: IIRC, it IS an official benfit to be allowed access to the VS CH at LHR when flying VS in Y if holding BD *G (but not AFAIK UC check-in and security). "

Which F lounge at LAX?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8059-/page1, Departing from LAX you only have one lounge available unless you are connecting from a USA or Canada flight. TBIT has *A F lounge for you. No arrivals lounge for SQ anywhere.

I can well imagine your anticipation. I have great memories of those same flights. The *A F lounge in TBIT is a bit of a let down though. 
Which F lounge at LAX?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8059-/page1," There is a public, pre-security lounge in the TBIT that can be used as an arrivals lounge. However, unless it's been remodeled since last January, not only are there no showers inside there's not even a bathroom inside. One of the major perks of lounges is cleaner bathrooms than the rest of the airport, so this is a major design flaw. That said, the lounge is quiet and has a great view of the tarmac, a nice drink selection, and free internet terminals. Passes are sold by the hour or day. To get there, go up to the check-in/departures level, head towards the security check, but instead of going right or left go upstairs. I believe it's called the Refresh Lounge. "
VS Gold:  EWR + Other Lounges + Gold Baggage,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/2281-/page1," As some of you maybe aware last time I did the EWR-SIN flight I flirted my way into the SQ (shared SAS) lounge; half by saying it was a VS FC red benefit (white lie, I know), half by flirting and mainly the agent was not the brightest. But now I am Gold. Newark is not one of the SQ lounges listed on the VS site as to access so I e-mail VS. They replied this: I would like to inform that as a Flying Club Gold card member benefit, you will be able to access either the SQ Lounge or our Clubhouse regardless of booked class or allocation (VS or SQ). So do you think I would be allowed in the SQ (SAS) lounge and the VS CH if I bought a copy of this e-mail? Any past tips experience? Any issues using the VS Gold card to access the Premier lounge and KrisLounges in SYD? Also has anyone used the extra baggage benefit on SQ? Whichever class you fly in, you automatically receive priority airport standby and priority boarding, plus priority baggage loading and an additional 20kg excess baggage allowance. "

A friend of mine was given the baggage privileges (priority baggage tagging, extra allowance) and access to the SATS Premier Lounge the couple of times he travelled in SQ Y [LHR-SIN] as VS Gold. Just to be safe, I'd have that printout and would politely ask for a supervisor's help in clarifying the rules, should a ground agent insist on an interpretation that contradicts the email. I'm not sure how to extrapolate those experiences to a contract lounge like the SAS Lounge in EWR. Personally, I'd trust the email and cover my bases by printing out a hardcopy and asking for a supervisor if necessary (and of course, using the charm that has served you well in the past ).

In fact SQ can go and get stuffed, I simply won't use them for long haul connections through SIN in Y in future. Cathay will let me into the F lounge in HKG as oneworld Emerald, and Qantas will allow me the same in SYD and MEL flying Y where I can not only have a shower but I can also grab a facial for earning top tier status.

[SIN T3] Temporary Krisflyer Gold Lounge (Shared Marhaba Lounge),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15400-/page1," There are major lounge renovations works going on in Changi T3, with renovations ongoing at the original T3 Krisflyer Gold Lounge. In the mean time, Krisflyer Elite Gold and Star Alliance Gold members have been directed to a temporary lounge, which is a shared space with the existing Marhaba Lounge, which has now been rebranded with a separate new Krisflyer Gold Lounge entrance. It must be tough being a lounge dragon at Changi these days. In the space of 3 minutes while I was at the lounge entrance, I observed the lounge staff at the Gold Lounge entrance directing business class pax to the SilverKris Lounge, as well as (politely) declining admission to a non-FF SQ premium economy flyer who thought she had access. I am sure the staff at the SilverKris Lounge also spend a lot of time directing Star Alliance flyers in economy over to this Gold Lounge as well. I visited the lounge at 8am yesterday, on a Sunday morning, and it was very busy. As fellow SQTalkers KC*, sqtrans, and davidfusq also mentioned in another thread, this lounge used to be the Marhaba Lounge, and is not large (Noticeably smaller than the previous T3 KF Gold Lounge). Seating area, with single-seater chairs, tables, as well as bar-style work tops... There is a long passageway with F&B laid out along one corridor... At the other end of the corridor, you reach another seating area, which turns out to be the seating area (and entrance) of the Marhaba Lounge. In other words, apart from separate entrances for Marhaba and Krisflyer Gold, this is the same lounge, with shared catering along the corridor and complete freedom of movement across the two areas. The fact that both entrances led to the same lounge sort of reminded me of this Simpsons cartoon ... It was a fairly bright and airy lounge, with decent views. "

[SIN T3] Temporary Krisflyer Gold Lounge (Shared Marhaba Lounge),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/15400-/page1," Overall, a decent, but unexceptional lounge, with positives being good F&B and a nice airy ambience. The only issue with this lounge is that it is likely to be way too small for the crowd at peak periods, given the number of KF Gold and Star Alliance Gold pax go through Changi. Thanks for reading! "

The other thing people may like to know is that while there are showers, there are only 3 or 4 rooms and I believe they are also used as toilets. If you want to have a shower you need to go get a buzzer from the attendant (sometimes hiding somewhere). So make sure not to leave the shower to the last minute in case they are not available or the wait is long. "

Does the Silver Kris Lounge in T2 or T3 allow a guest that is flying economy? Will they let my Dad in as a guest and based on the fact that he is immediate family and coming in on a Biz Class ticket? Do SKL T2 and T3 lounges offer day passes? I thought I read somewhere on here that you can have a guest do the SKL in SIN. Does anyone have a link to exact SQ rules and policies? Thanks. "

Agreed, according to the letter of the law. But I think the OP has two good opportunities to have things work out well. First, if an entering group shows two valid Business Class boarding passes at the SKL entrance, it is quite possible that they will not ask to see the BP for the 3rd person. Second, if they do ask, I think a polite request to allow the Y pax in is not likely to be refused - given his two J class companions and his own arrival in J. "

Which Silver Kris lounge on F ticket but Business Class Seat?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4407-/page1," Hi SQTalkers, This is my first post so be gentle with me! I was lucky enough a couple of months ago to secure an SQ First class RTW fare (travelling from Australia) at a very reasonable price (after drooling over this fare offer for several months I bought it, and then it was withdrawn the next day!). In fact, with all the 777W and A380 surcharges they add on, it wasn't much higher than the business fare. I decided that it would be nice to fly on the A380 so arranged to depart Australia out of Sydney rather than Adelaide where I live. However, due to the way in which SQ have (I think) complicated their fare structure with the new R class, an F class RTW only allows travel in business (D) class on the A380. So I was wondering if anybody might know if on a F RTW ticket I will be able to use the SK First Class lounge at Sydney airport, because my boarding pass will be issued as Business Class. Also if I want to use the BTC service, would I be able to choose from the F class menu or have to use the J class menu? I am really not too concerned either way but was just curious if anyone might know the answers to these questions. I do think that the way SQ have structured their new suites class is a bit unsustainable due to these sorts of complications that it appears to create. Anyway, I'd be interested if anyone can help with my questions... Thanks. "

I don't think you will get access to the SKL F at SYD with a Business Class Boarding Pass. In fact I'm pretty sure you won't. FWIW the F lounge at SYD is no better than the J side anyway, in fact I prefer the latter. Even better than both is the NZ lounge at the bottom of the corridor. I am sure the same will apply to your BTC, but I don't suppose it would hurt to ask. On a related note, as much as I can understand you want to 'fly the A380' etc, I would personally go for F on either than 744 or the 77W rather than J on the A380. There is no surcharge for F on the 77W. F is still F is still F, and especially on SQ, F is not something that should be given up easily, A380 or not. Just my tuppence worth... "
Which Silver Kris lounge on F ticket but Business Class Seat?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4407-/page1," Entry to the SKL is dependent on class of travel of the relevant departure flight, not the class of your paid fare I'm afraid. I reckon this will also apply to your BTC. I agree with MAN Flyer - NZ lounge at SYD (which you'd be able to access) is much nicer than even the SKL F, decor is a lot better. Unfortunately I've not been on the A380 so am in no position to recommend one flight over another, but I do usually subscribe to the notion of ""F is still F"" unless other factors get in the way like the ability to avoid a complicated connection, better schedules etc. Personally I'd go for an F cabin and F service when I've paid for an F fare.

Which Silver Kris lounge on F ticket but Business Class Seat?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4407-/page1," Thanks for your quick replies Manflyer and KeithMel! Some very good info and advice regarding SYD lounges to use. I suspected that what you both said may be the case, but thought I'd ask anyway. I'll probably ask on the day just to see what they say! There were a few reasons for choosing this flight out of the 4 daily flights to Singapore - it allowed a good time margin to my connecting flight to Zurich (3.5 hours instead of only 1 hour - plus time to check out the SKL at SIN); not too early so that I would have to catch a red eye from ADL to SYD; and of course the ""novelty"" of trying out the A380 J class. I figure I have another 4 sectors on this trip to experience SQ F class (2 x 744 and 2 x 777W) so can live with the A380 J sector (and also the 777-200 J only service to ADL). I checked out the BTC menus and from SYD they are almost the same anyway (no lobster thermidor in J class!) "
Which Silver Kris lounge on F ticket but Business Class Seat?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4407-/page1," The lounge access based on the boarding pass. Yours would be the C blue. Thus, the lounge staff will direct you to the SKL C side. But, since you have a connecting flight in SIN in F, if you show both BPs, the lounge dragon might let you go to the F side. (But it's not a guarantee though.) If your travel is after 1st of July, hope you will be able to use The Private Room at T3 SKL as an F boarding pass holder. BTC is definitely based on the booking class. The reservation just look at the class you are booked on, which is C. Thus, no lobster thermidor. Reading your explanation, your last leg would be for SIN-ADL in 777-200 in J. This would be hard after all those A380 in C, and 744 in F as well as 77W in F. In my opinion, I would fly to MEL or SIN to get the F in 77W or 744 instead. Lastly, another welcome to SQTalk. "

This was the designated lounge for eligible UA FF pax travelling Y. I am Star Gold, and could also have used the Krisflyer Gold Lounge in T2, but decided to check out the SATS Premier Lounge instead. Star Gold members can guest 1 pax into the lounge. This is a newish lounge, with a large seating area decorated with orchids. It was busy that morning, but not too crowded. There is a dining area with both hot and cold, Asian and International, breakfast selections. Small counter-style seating area and several small dining tables.

I felt that the SATS Premier Lounge was a notch up from the United Club lounges in US airports, which are available to Star Gold pax travelling Y. Compared to United Clubs, the SATS lounge had a better catering selection, and also of showers (I did not see showers in the United Club lounges in SFO or LAX). That said, the United Club lounges usually have a full bar (With a full paid beverage menu + a limited selection of complimentary alcoholic/non-alcoholic beverages), which is a nice feature to have in a lounge.

ARRIVAL in MEL: First Class baggage (for all FCL baggage came after JCL, Crew, and half of the YCL load...) Summary: Fares (return) increased for SIN/Australia/SIN in FCL from 7k+ to 9k+ after COVID.....above review plus poor call centre service prior to the trip does not provide an acceptable price/value scenario. BA offers sub 7k fares to/from SIN/SYD and offers a much better lounge experience on both ends and once QF re-starts its QF1/QF2 run to LHR via SIN, at least Sydney bound customers have more choices. However, some very good news for SQ management here: Singaporeans seemingly want to ""support, support"" and pay above market fares for less service. Additionally,, less competition out of SIN provides sometimes a monopoly in certain areas for SQ. Good for the short term but not a viable long term business model....unless Singaporeans continue their ""support, support"" mentality ... many Australians already concluded that QF is now better in terms of seat, inflight catering, and lounges. Stunning considering that Aussie's love to come down hard on their national carrier. "

It's piss poor. Even by J standards. Lounge - This was in March. Lounge had enough seats for 6pm departure, but in a mess. Single choice of red and white wine in wine dispensers were empty and not refilled during my 45mins lounge visit. Sad empty bottle of whiskey sat on the counter for 45mins as well. Nuts etc were out of stock. Food quality noticeably poorer. Sure the govt. doesn't allow open buffet, but at least top up the limited options you are offering. Changi - Never understood why the cannot offer fast track/priority at the gate security for F/J. Even CX manages to do it at an outport like Changi when they were operating from T1. And for all the bullshit about how Changi is the best airport in the world, they can't even get their taxi supply right. It's always a good 20mins wait these days taking a taxi from Changi. Flight - Hot towels not available (Fair enough if they're singing the covid song) Catering quality dropped a fair bit. Of course they claim that out of safety everything is pre-packaged and hence no trolley of cheese etc. 1 toilet blocked in J blocked for crew. (Of course, using covid as an excuse again). I don't think it would enhance safety that much. Arrival - Was told no fast track because of covid. This was just ridiculous. I thought all the more they should give fast track so that passengers get out of the crowded airport quickly. Crew - Good. Could tell they were trying hard to make things work. Needless to say, my trips in Apr and May went to competitors offering better products. Singaporean here who does not accept SQ's pricing vs product. "

But SQ F/R pax have by virtue of *A rules the right to bring one guest into the designated F lounge, which is TPR (yes I realise LH doesn't follow the rules either by allowing guests but requiring the guest to be on the same flight).

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page2," The idea, I think, is to have an environment where all the patrons are all in Suites and First Class on SQ only. Thus by allowing a guest who might be flying J or Y, will diminish the value of being R or F pax. The argument was that, from the customer inputs, the majority of SQ R and F pax prefer not to share the lounge with other than R and F pax only. They prefer not to have someone brings guest who flies in J or Y. Of course, for us, that would be a disappointment, because we have the opportunity to have lounge meets with other flyers. But hey, majority of those SQ R and F pax are not on line here nor the other forum. "
Which SQ lounge at SIN can we use?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/9542-/page2," Originally posted by MegatopLover View Post Well, I learned after starting this thread that TG has downgraded Mr. Megatop's status from Gold to Silver. So no lounge access for him at all. I guess he'll chill in duty free whilst my friend (first-time visitor to SIN) and I scope out SKL T3. Mr. Megatop skulks around duty free half the time we're in the airport anyway, and he up and disappears for the other half. So this would be little different. To be honest, if there is an airport in the world that has so many decent options that lounge access is somewhat irrlevant it's Changi. I tend to think this must be SQ's thinking such is the lack of thought in their lounges, especially the abandoned SKL's in T2. In T2 I don't even bother with the SKL nowadays. If I have been away a while I will nip in and see if there any UK newspapres to read (bizarrely there are more available in T2 SKL with no UK flights than T3, go figure...) other than that I just go somewhere nice and pay for my food and drink.

[JNB] SAA Baobab Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8506-/page1," f/up from my previous query, and helpful responses from SQTalkers, here're some pics. Star Alliance (Elite Gold and Business class) entitled to the SAA Baobab Lounge on the 2nd storey of the international departures. Not to be confused with the Cycad which is 1st class lounge. Reception manned by 2 very nice and friendly ladies, after which one turns left thru this corridor. A bank of 3 PCs are on the right.WiFi as an earlier SQTalker pointed out was by payment. Just at the end of the corridor to the right, theres little cafe corner where sandwiches, muffins, cookies are available besides liquor and beverages. Counter is manned by abt 3 staff and there was a queue but a moving one, and service was polite and prompt. Heres another view of the cafe from far end of the lounge, with an overview of the rest area. Low ceiling and proximate arrangement of sofas made for rather crowded feel. View of the duty free, and apron beyond that, from the lounge. I have came across quite a few posts in other sites that suggest this to be a dreadful place, but overall, my experience has been satisfactory; provided me with a place for coffee and rest between my SQ and onward connection.

Firstly, the lounge, while pretty near the security check is not located in a very obvious place. Signage is limited. Secondly, the food (mostly snacks) and drinks available are limited and of poor quality. Thirdly, no free wifi; however there's complimentary wifi available from the airport but it's limited to only half an hour. Didn't bother with the shower facilities. On a positive note, the seats were comfortable. "
Barcelona J Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/8727-/page1," I also agree, a very disappointing lounge. I was there last month and the paltry food was looking quite sad and picked over and no action was taken to replenish items when i was there. Especially as I was flying F, the lounge did not even come close to matching the service level one expects. On the other end of the spectrum, I flew ANA first from NRT-IAD last week and fell in love with the ANA Suites lounge in NRT. Really outstanding -- maybe the best I have experienced. Great experience on board too. "

The joint QF/BA lounges (speaking from experiences in SIN and HKG here) are usually staffed by QF agents who're known to be quite lax with enforcing official policy. I've managed to guest up to 4 people into the SIN lounge. Maybe you could try your luck with the BKK lounge bouncers. "

Only first and business class passengers allowed entry as there are a number of departures at a late timing so the lounge was full of SQ and EVA passengers when I was there Thursday night. No shower facilities either but the furniture is nicely spaced out which meant it was nowhere as crammed as the SQ lounge though not allowing *A Gold members definitely helped reduce the crowding situation which is a nice change. I typically stay out of lounges as it's uncomfortably crowded. Time to raise the bar for *A Gold qualification. "

However, after checking in and clearing security/immigration at ICN, most pax would also have walked past the Asiana Business Lounge in the main terminal airside area before heading via peoplemover to the satellite terminal. On a recent trip to Seoul, I decided to check out this lounge instead of the one in the satellite terminal, just to see if there was any difference in what the two lounges had to offer. "

A decent lounge, larger than the SQ Silver Kris Lounge in the satellite terminal, but very similar to the Asiana Lounge in the satellite terminal. In fact, I would say the Asiana Lounge in the satellite terminal holds its own against the main terminal in almost all respects. I would say the two Asiana lounges are largely equivalent, except that the main lounge has some views of the tarmac. Unless the tarmac views mean a lot to you, I would still pick the Asiana Business Lounge in the satellite terminal as first choice if you are flying SQ, mainly because of the proximity to the SQ boarding gates.

The latter has live cooking station where the cook can prepare noodles or laksa for you. There are also more plenty sit down meal area for you rather than sitting on sofa and balancing the dishes with your hands. It is usually not as crowded as well as less airlines contract it for use in Changi. There is also a view of the runway from the lounge. The SATS Premier lounge do have massage chair which you can use if no one is using, but the Plaza Premium Lounge has these productivity pods for your to seclude yourself if you need to get things done. The walk from T1 back to T2 will be far though because the Plaza Premium lounge is located on the opposite side of the skytrain to T2. Alternatively, if you are only looking for good food in a relatively quiet environment, I would recommend TGM at T2, just opposite SATS Premier Lounge. It is a restaurant run by the Plaza Premium Group and features decent Korean and Japanese food (better than the food served inside SATS Premier Lounge. Note that all the above lounges are accessible using Priority Pass. "

In fact, this is an area which Changi airport could improve on. The vegetarian options at these two lounges would probably be some vegetables dishes tucked amidst the meat dishes. Or some salad greens and if lucky enough some non meat sandwiches. Perhaps the SATS Premier lounge may have slight advantage in this area since they service some Air India flights there which has demand for vegetarian food.

They suggested maybe i could log into my account on my phone and show them proof of my current status. They suggested I could go to the gate and wait for SQ staff to be there and then they could call them and confirm. I then had to politely and tactfully point out that a boarding pass printed 15 minutes ago is a fairly obvious indication of current *A Gold status. Then showed them the OLCI printouts which had the words ""Elite Gold"" on them.

I only had a brief moment inside, grabbed a few photos, downed a half-cup of coffee and off I went. So apologies for the brevity. Location - after clearing immigration, the lounge was found on on the left not too far away but signage was not particularly good. Could easily have been missed. The J lounge is roomy and not crowded at all in the late morning that I visited. Furnishing reminds me of IKEA, but the place is bright and airy. Here is the coffee machine I headed straight for. Haha... I think there is a self-serve draft beer, some liquor, pastries and light cold snacks... but I was in too much of a rush to look carefully. Also forgot to take a pic. Apologies. I wasn't particularly impressed by the coffee at my hotel so I was hoping for a good brew here but was disappointed to see an identical machine. Coffee tasted somewhat similar to my earlier cuppa... so I did not finish it. Decided to get a more decent cup on board. There was an interesting section with high tables and TVs with sports channels. Perhaps this area would be livelier in the evenings but in the morning, it was quite empty. Further in was another lounge area. Very quiet but the window opened out landside, so no view of the planes. A few meeting tables... Most of the people seemed to have gravitated to the PCs.

[SFO] VS - Clubhouse,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/456-/page3," The SFO Clubhouse, has always been a favourite with V-Flyers. Like all of Virgin's overseas facilities, it was hit by the decision a couple of years ago to out-source staff. Recently however, one of the best members of staff from the old days, who was dumped during the outsourcing; has been re-hired, and things appear to be looking up. In answer to the original question, I have read the TR you refer to, and am guessing that the sandwich was his meal of choice. No one else has mentioned a deterioration of the food service, and I am pretty sure they would have, as it is a well used Clubhouse by V-Flyers. Some people choose to eat lightly in the CH and then have a full meal on board - for others, the opposite is true. (Virgin's on board UC food is subject of variable reviews, and is not to everyone's taste.) If I was offered CH entry at SFO for $40 I would jump at it every time, (depending on how much time I have at the airport) - the CH is landside, so if the security queues are long, you have to bear this in mind when leaving to catch the plane. Edit to add: Having re-read the Virgin America offer. it only talks about 'snacks and sandwiches'. Thinking about it. The CH has only previously been open for the three hours prior to the departure of the VS020. If these opening times have been extending to allow access to Virgin America First Class pax, it doesn't necessarily follow that the chef's hours have also been extended. Therefore - unless you are there in the three hours before the 5.25pm departure of VS020, you may only have a limited menu. Nick "

Back on topic: I'm sitting in the SFO Clubhouse right now waiting for the last flight so I can insure that taipeiflyer and I can drink some nice beverages (sorry KeithMEL) this evening. Lots of things I can now confirm from the VX standpoint: Once you have paid the $40 fee, you will be issued an additional BP with ""CLUBHOUSE"" hand written on it (kinda funny if you ask me): Surrender it to the Lounge Dragon and you're in. As Nottingham Nick noted, it's really only worth the fee if you're there before VS020. The Lounge Dragons confirmed that the full menu (to follow) is served from 13:00 to 16:00. However, the large influx of VX pax (there was quite a nice stack of passes when I checked in so they're making good $$$ on this benefit) combined with the VS pax makes the lounge quite full by 15:00. Read: Get there early. [Around the time I was there, they had run out of quite a few things.] The Definition of ""snacks and sandwiches"": Rolled Gold Pretzels, Nature's Valley Granola Bars, Miss Vickie's Chips, Apples, Bananas, and Yoplait Yogurt. The bar was quite nice (although quite trashed from all the people who were in there), though I wouldn't partake in any of the wines as they weren't that good. The hard liquor (""spirits"") was quite a nice selection. I asked for a snifter of Pyrat XO Rum with a couple ice cubes. The bartender (who was on her first day and does come from the Sodex [sp?] outsourcing company) didn't know what it was or how to pour it so she filled the glass to the top. That was over seven shots of rum and I was quite looped by the time I boarded (another reason I'm editing this post ). More pictures would have been taken, but the entire area was a complete mess and all the employees were cleaning it up. "

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page26," Hi all, I was wondering if any of you freq flyers have ever thought the TPR was initially meant to be a rest area with private rooms & / or spa attached to the 1st class lounge ? Perhaps SQ realised the 1st class lounge was going to be overcrowded & a poor (sub-par) lounge compared to the competition such as Qantas, BA, CX lounge .. so, what was meant to be a private room for rest areas (like T2) & SPA facilities had to be scrapped and made into a 1st class only lounge (today's TPR). A few reasons ... 1) If SQ most values its premium passengers (suites and 1st) why would it leave the TPR opening so behind the main lounges? If it was to always be for suites / 1st only, it surely should have opened at the same time given there is nothing so different in it compared to the 1st lounge next to it? 2) If it was for suites and 1st only WHY shove it at the back of the 1st class lounge? Many carriers have a separate lounge area completely (eg Lufthansa) OR if designing it why not place it on the immediate lefthand side as soon as you arrive at the lounge complex so you can access it more quickly. If you're flying and a valued customer why make them walk versus having a discreet entrance as soon as you arrive at the lounge? I thought the aim was to make their journey the easiest. 3) Even T2 (as old and lovely as it is) 1st class lounge has a rest area with those ergonomic beds. It also has an area where no phones were allowed to be used = rest area. It is surprising that T2 1st class lounge has a rest area and the newest offering in T3 has none - was the TPR meant to house these? Additionally, I know T2 1st class lounge doesn't SPA facilities but it was built way before SPA's were considered as part of a 1st Class lounge experience. Thai, Virgin (Biso), Qantas NOW all have spa facilities and as a premium carrier I thought SQ would have wanted to have a SPA area in their new flagship terminal 3 lounge. Perhaps the TPR was initially meant to be an area for private rest rooms and spa treatment rooms but when 1stly, SQ realised how busy the 1st lounge was and the overcrowding it faced and 2ndly, how lovely and great other airlines 1st class lounges were being made, it needed to create a 'better, more exclusive' lounge than the existing 1st class lounge to not fall terribly behind the competition. So TPR was born (or it could have always been designed as the TPR - private rest rooms and spa treatment rooms). Also having had the opportunity to visit the TPR several times now, it has dawned on me that the amount of room would most definitely suit an area hosting rest rooms and spa treatment rooms. It sits adjacent to the 1st class lounge for easy access, has its own reception for which room/spa bookings could be made and the area could easily be divided into 15-20 rest areas/treatment rooms. I know we'll never know but your thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks. "

[MEL]SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14974-/page1," Earlier this month, I visited the MEL SilverKris Lounge before my flight to Singapore on SQ's A350. Unlike SQ's SYD lounge, this lounge has not yet been updated to the new ""Home Away from Home"" decor, but the decor is elegant and attractive in its own right. There is a small dedicated business centre close to the lounge entrance. There are several seating areas, with a variety of seating options. This is not a particularly large lounge. At the time I was there it was busy, but not over crowded. "
[MEL]SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14974-/page1," There is a dedicated dining area, done in a slightly sterile white and grey colour scheme...

[MEL]SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14974-/page1," There are restroom facilities in the lounge, as well as 2 shower rooms. Regarding the shower rooms, here is a tip which I picked up from Kyo: The two shower rooms are unisex. One is next to the men's restroom, and the other next to the ladies' room around the corner. If the shower next to the men's restroom is occupied, it is worth checking if the other one around the corner next to the ladies' room is available. "
[MEL]SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14974-/page1," Apart from the business class section of the lounge, there is a dedicated first class section as well. I peeked into the first class section on the way out: "
[MEL]SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14974-/page1," Compared to the QF MEL lounge nearby, the SQ lounge is smaller, but roughly of about the same standard overall i.e. both are decent but not the nicest lounges in either SQ's or QF's network. Overall the MEL SilverKris Lounge is a decent offering, although it will need a refresh to bring it up to the same level as the newly refreshed SYD lounge (or the BKK SilverKris Lounge, for that matter). I would use this lounge as a pit stop for a snack, a drink and a shower before heading back to the MEL airside area, where there is ample shopping (and F&B too) to keep one occupied prior to boarding. "
[MEL]SilverKris Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14974-/page1," Another great set of photos. A lounge I've spent a lot of time in! The service is really good and there is quite a lot of seating available usually, but getting a little tired. It's not the best but not the worst, but they keep it very clean compared to some other lounges I've seen. In fact, I might even head over there tomorrow afternoon. One thing I have been thinking about lately though, is how it will cope with the re-timed SQ248. SQ228's crowd have usually headed to gate (I'm using winter timings here and not referring to myself, but the flight) by about 1500 and SQ208's check-in opens at about 1515, so there's no concern about overlap. The new SQ248 heading back from WLG and then collecting (one would assume) more passengers from MEL will have its departure time directly in between SQ228 and SQ208, meaning it will overlap with both of these flights. Might get a little tight for space. "

Perhaps it's purpose is to discourage oxygen stick users to spend too much time inside but for heavy oxygen takers like myself the room is the sanctuary so badly needed after being stuck in a metal tube for long hours

SYD SKL : now open following refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/12583-/page3," Relax guys. I work for neither company. It was a question off the top of my head and this is an internet discussion forum. Okay poor example earlier but there are partner lounges MH can use in T2 like the SATS lounge. I simply asked why these airlines would want to maintain lounges in each other's homebases instead of using an existing lounge.. Just a thought especially considering how SQ is so cost-conscious. When I flew SQ J from NRT I used the NH lounge since SQ doesn't have a Silverkris there. The NH lounge wasn't nice at all and barely offered any snacks beyond onigiri and a sandwitch. And that is a 6 hour flight.. plus it is an airport where SQ operates not just J but F cabins from. So with that perspective, why would they want to maintain a lounge in KLIA when they could use an existing one and not build a Silverkris in NRT (for example) to add to the earlier question. And thanks for the interrogative tone as if this were the court of law. A quick glance and the first two pages of the main thread reveals many threads full of question and rumour threads which are met with rational perspectives. Yet when I asked a question here I get flammed. I know a post I made 5 years ago had unwittingly offended a few but nice to know the grudges have been held so strongly so long. Thanks guys "

If you are flying from FRA, SQ F uses the LH Senator F Lounge. At least that was the one I was directed to. Let's just say it looks like a barn. Lots of people. Tiny seats. Nice big windows though. Food was a tragedy. And wireless internet is chargeable although they have web ready computer stations. I found myself wanting to be the first on the plane. Had to get out of the lounge. "

Welcome to SQTalk alexbyl Flying SQ in F you have access to LH SEN lounges and UA IFL. For FRA-JFK the flight departs from pier C and UA IFL is the closest lounge. LH SEN lounge above gate B 42 is moderately close but you need to allow time for a security check between lounge and gate. For FRA-SIN the flight departs from pier B usually a gate numbered in the 40s, thus the LH SEN lounge above gate B 42 is the closest lounge. If you were flying LH in F then you'd have access to the far nicer LH FCL and FCT. "

[SIN T3]  SKL C,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3295-/page3," My parents routing is as follows: BKK-SIN-SGN , All on SQ & in J class. BKK-SIN 14th Feb SIN-SGN 15th Feb They are staying overnight at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport (on 14th Feb) which is outside immigration. They actually want to use the Silver Kris J class lounge for a short while upon arrival in SIN from BKK, however, the lounge is for departing pax only. My parents do not want to stay at the transit hotel inside OR stay overnight in the Silver Kris lounge. So can they at 1) BKK check in, request boarding passes all the way to SGN, & they use the SGN boarding pass to enter Silver Kris lounge in SIN, & then they exit immigration to stay at Crowne Plaza, the next morning they just use the boarding pass for SGN to re-enter immigration again? Will there be any issue? They will have no issue to check in all their baggage from BKK-SGN direct. 2) Alternatively, if they need all their baggage in SIN, can they at BKK check in, request boarding pass for SGN as well, BUT check in baggage only till SIN so they can take their baggage out in SIN & enjoy Silver Kris lounge access at same time upon arrival? 3) Or if 2) NOT permitted, how about another way is at BKK check in counter, only request boarding pass to SIN and baggage just to SIN only, & upon reaching SIN, at Transfer Counter request boarding pass to SGN, then they can use the Silver Kris Lounge, and then they can collect their baggage after that, and the next day just re-enter immigration again using the SGN boarding pass. Appreciate any advise & apologise if my words are unclear & it confuses you. "
[SIN T3]  SKL C,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3295-/page3," feb01mel, there should be no problems getting the BPs issued at BKK, even for the SIN-SGN sector. And I am sure they can even ask for their baggage to be checked in only to SIN citing that they may need stuff for the overnight stay, however, if this is the case, they would need to collect their baggage when they reach SIN. I do not think the authorities will be too happy if they leave their baggage unattended at the carousel considering the hightened security now-a-days. Probably the best way is to check it (baggage) in all the way, get all the boarding passes issued at BKK and use the lounge. Not a problem at all if they need to clear CIQ and go back in the next day with their SIN-SGN BPs (unless of course if they require a visa to enter Singapore). "
[SIN T3]  SKL C,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3295-/page3," Your trip may be done but this is for future reference of those in similar cases or want to be more creative in their routing. Generally, it would be nice if you book the BKK-SIN and SIN-SGN tickets separately. That is in a single booking session, book the BKK-SIN leg and once booking is completed, you are issued a booking reference code for that leg alone. Only then shall you do the same for SIN-SGN and you are issued a separate booking reference code. Therefore when you check-in at BKK, since they have separate booking reference codes, the staff at BKK would not automatically assume you have a SIN-SGN flight unless you quote the 2nd booking code. Hence they won't access the SIN-SGN flight you booked and won't tag your luggage through SGN. I helped booked flights for my folks and was scared that because the MNL-SIN and SIN-DPS flights were separately booked (due to SK mileage issues), they may not be able to check their luggage through from MNL to DPS. If you want boarding passes for SIN-SGN, it would be best to obtain them online. Just have them validated at SIN. There is 1 important consideration in doing this: as you are treating those 2 flights separately and technically not using SIN as a connecting point for your next flight, your flights will be priced separately as 2 one-way flights. One-way flights are less cost-effective and can even be higher than deeply discounted ""round-trip"" or 1-stop flights. One way to mitigate costs is to book a BKK-SIN-BKK trip separately from a SIN-SGN-SIN trip rather than do 4 legs separately. Make sure that that the SIN-SGN flight leaves after the BKK-SIN flight and the SGN-SIN leaves before the return SIN-BKK flight (even just hours before). "

This will be my second post and I decided to write a review about the recently renovated SilverKris Lounge at Hong Kong International Airport. Hope y'all like it! Before my flight back home on SQ861, I had some time to check out the recently renovated SilverKris Lounge at Hong Kong Airport. https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0387.jpg The ambience of the lounge was warm and inviting. It was well-furnished with many comfortable seats and sofas. The interior of lounge was tasteful and interesting: https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0394.jpg For drinks, I went with a glass of Champagne. I think it was Dom Pérignon. The bar inside the lounge had various other cocktails including the usual Bloody Marys and Singapore Slings. https://becausegoodfooddeservestobes...2/img_0396.jpg For noms noms I ordered a bowl of Laksa. Haha, I never imagined that I would eat a bowl of Laksa in Hong Kong so this was quite an experience!

"[ZRH] ""New"" Swiss First and HON Circle Lounge",http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/2849-/page1," Just opened yesterday, 15 December 2007. Location: near the Transfer Desk towards Gate A. There is a glass door near the far right security line. Well the circular stairs will give you a good exercise for carrying up your rollabag. But there is a lift, but no sign yet for the lounge. The style is similar to LH FCT or FCL, but at the moment I can not take any pictures since the lounge is full. Basically once you go up the stairs, there will be few staff behind the counter. To the right, there are meeting rooms, and two different room which not that big. I guess the smaller room can be closed for VIP only. Behind the receptionist there are couple rooms for working (desk and accessories). To the left of the receptionist, there is the dining room (white table cloth) with small bar. Not well stock at all, I must say. Next to the dining room, there is the buffet with main sofa's around. About 32 dark brown sofas plus another 4 in front of television with in-wall style bookcase. Buffet? It's a laugh at the moment. Three different thing in the warmer but now empty. I think one was only brocolli with potatoes. One was salmon with vegetables. And will check the othe one later. Some wines on display. Champagne ice bucket is by Taittinger. But now a new bottle had not been opened. The one I had was some other brand. There are some small plates for pate as well as a small fish. In short, yes better than the old Swiss First Lounge upstairs near the Business Lounge. But its far away from FRA FCT nor FCL. Note: I did go to the receptionist telling her that o food left on the buffet. Another note: I was told that I will take a shuttle bus to the gate wher I will depart. Will post limited pictures taken later. "

This is a bit of a grey area to be honest. If you have an F ticket and on the same ticket flying onwards in JCL on a flight with no F, you can get in TPR. I have done this on a number of flights to BKK and SGN in the last 12 months when I was inbound in F. I have even got access when arriving in F (Suites) and onwards on a sperate ticket in J by showing the Gold BP. Having said that, I don't think the White Ladies themselves are sure of the rules. In January three of us were on the last schedued 744 pax flight from Europe (SQ25 from FRA on 16 Jan) in F. Of the three I was onwards in J to BNE, another was flying to CGK in F and another to PER in J. The F ticket to CGK obviously got access to TPR, I also did with my F BP from FRA but the pax flying to PER was refused entry. The only difference was the PER pax was not Solitaire, but as TPP is not a criteria for entry, apparently, it made no sense. We instead went to the F lounge and then when the PER pax left to get her flight the two of us went back to TPR and I again got entry with my F BP. They should have made an official announcement about all this as they only starting allowing access to people flying on in J in the last coupe of years. But as they never even made an official announcement about TPR opening in the first place (not surprising with the ridiculous ban on people on award tickets using it) it is not surprising they haven't made one about the rules changes.

If not many staff there then they will take them to the entrance to the F lounge and the staff member there escorts them to TPR, thus leaving the F entrance 'unguarded'. "

Of the three I was onwards in J to BNE, another was flying to CGK in F and another to PER in J. The F ticket to CGK obviously got access to TPR, I also did with my F BP from FRA but the pax flying to PER was refused entry. The only difference was the PER pax was not Solitaire, but as TPP is not a criteria for entry, apparently, it made no sense. We instead went to the F lounge and then when the PER pax left to get her flight the two of us went back to TPR and I again got entry with my F BP. The rules of entering the TPR are rather inconsistent. A month ago, I posted here when passenger A (TPP) flying in F/R guested passenger B flying in J/Y. The whole incident was handled with a complete lack of discretion. Both pax originated from SIN. A came in first and started talking to the waiters about how the receptionists are being ""very sticky with entry rules"". He then proceeded to order drinks and meals for 2 people and told the waiter to deliver it to the table at the FCL where he will have it with B. He then left the TPR. Five minutes later, A returned and took his seat. He was joined by B moments after, complete with plates and cutlery from the FCL area. Heard every word they said and they did not make an effort to keep their voices down when thanking the TPR supervisor for the ""exception"" granted to them. When I raised the anomaly to another TPR staff when leaving, the lady was dumbfounded and merely blinked a couple of times at me. I didn't ask any more as the buggy driver was waiting for me. "

A month ago, I posted here when passenger A (TPP) flying in F/R guested passenger B flying in J/Y. Absolutely, that's why I said they really do need clarifying. But the absence of official announcements on all things TPR seem to prevent this. Another daft example of inconsistency was when I once asked them to confirm that any inbound flight in F with onward in J on flight with no F was allowed TPR access. They told me it was 'Suites only' inbound that got access. I queried this and said 'So if I buy a return ticket in First Class from Bangkok to London and I fly back on SQ317 or SQ321 I can come in, but if I fly back on SQ319 I can't ?'. 'Seriously?'. They said they would just recheck and confirm but I left for my flight before they got back to me. I feel for the staff there as they don't seem to have any clear rules about this. "

It starts depending how many staff are at the entrance. If there are plenty then one of them will escort F pax to TPR. If not many staff there then they will take them to the entrance to the F lounge and the staff member there escorts them to TPR, thus leaving the F entrance 'unguarded'. On my last TPR visit mid-Jan on R, there was only one white coat at SKL J entrance and she promptly escorted me straight into TPR, leaving nobody guarding the J entrance. On the way past the F desk, she gestured to the F attendant to cover the J gate. The F attendant knew it probably meant she had to find someone to cover the unmanned F desk temporarily also, as she scurried off. "

Krisgold member- FRA lounges which can I use?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6362-/page1, UA lounge is in the C part of terminal - hassle to get to unless you arrive or depart on a flight from there. OP has a Schengen to Schengen connection thus you'd also have pointless immigration (twice) to deal with. I'd stick with the most convenient schengen lounge (eg A26 if arriving or departing from pier A). Just remember flights aren't called and it can take a while to get from one part of terminal to another so don't leave the lounge too late. 
Krisgold member- FRA lounges which can I use?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6362-/page1, Does anyone know if AC flights departs from Area C like US flights or are they from Area B (non schengen area)? I am connecting from DXB to YYZ via FRA with DXB-FRA on LH a/c and the FRA-YYZ on AC a/c. This would then help me decide the right lounge to zzzz after the red eye flight. 
Krisgold member- FRA lounges which can I use?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6362-/page1," Unless there is only a short period of time until your flight no one can guarantee which part of the terminal will be used, other than it must be non-schengen zone. When you arrive from DXB just look at the monitors to see the onward gate. It will then be apparent where the closest *G lounge is. If in doubt, go to the B40s SEN lounge - most likely you will be going through or near this part of the terminal. "

No more shower facilities at SIN SQ lounge for EG and *G travelling in Y?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/10766-/page3," Originally posted by sqdazz View Post Yeah I am complaining about SQ and yes I know it's not the airport operators decision. I was simply saying that without showers for Star Golds in Y, the transit experience at Singapore Airlines (who think themselves to be an elite airline of the world) is absolute rubbish. As a 'elite gold' member one would expect to be treated with a little more respect and you certainly do get that with other airlines at their main hub. As for the TG lounge in SIN, I wouldn't expect a shower there as the only destination is BKK and it is merely 2 hours away so one could grab a shower during the transit in BKK. It is not a TG hub so doesn't matter. Flying QF in Y as a Qantas Gold or Platinum I can shower in any of the Australia-Europe connection points: SIN, BKK and HKG. Why can't SQ offer that? Agreed, it's stupid for SQ to eliminate this perk in its home base. But SQ has been operating on the basis that what they cannot see, cannot hurt them. "

It wouldn't be so bad if this was just a regional airline with short flights, but this is Changi, where many people arrive having flown for hours, before they reboard another aircraft and fly again for hours. It's farcical. Yes, I agree that elite passengers should be give this much needed perk by their respective airlines. Changi would obviously prefer it if SQ provides that perk but it's not Changi's call, I think. "

Even if SA contracts don't state this, if everyone else does it, it should really be the 'standard' of service. Especially from an Airline claiming to be the best...

Boy, have things changed from whenAsiaCommuter posted images of the copious TPR wine list. This is my second time here in three months. It seems now they don't even bother with printing a list. And the selection has now drastically shrunk to two reds and two whites. No more delicious Burgundies. Oh how far have the offerings fallen in such a short time. And unfortunately, the staff have not been given any background on the wines they do have. When I asked about their red wine offerings, I was only told thye have ""a shiraz"" and a ""chateau pauillac"". Turns out the French red wine he was referring to was an 04 Pichon Longueville. Thats a great bottle, and deserves a bit more presentation. How difficult is it to print out the wine list anyways? How difficult is it to instruct your staff how to offer the wines... as in, sir, we have a nice Pichon Longueville fom Pauillac, Bordeaux. For lovers of Champagne, dont worry, at least Veuve Grand Dame is still on offer. Also, I dont recommend the ""Waldorf Salad"" off the menu.

The LH lounges are a classic example, undoubtedly nice places but the lengths some people go to get in there and the times they allow to spend there continues to baffle me. The reputation the SKL F in T2 had prior to T3 opening was even worse. It was rated by some as the best lounge in the world!. It's amazing how you can gain favour by offering free Krug and then Dom. I would like to see SQ allowing to bring a guest who is on the same flight but not in F.

[HKG] United Club,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13265-/page1," I was chatting with one of the ground staff while in transit at HKG today enroute to Shenzhen, and she mentioned that the new SQ lounge would be open ""in a few days"", which I would take to mean some time this month, October. Until then, apart from the Plaza Premium Lounge, if you are Star Gold, you can check out the TG Lounge (Which I have not tried, but Man Flyer says it is pretty good), or you can use the United Club. On my flight SQ1 last week, I checked out the United Club, which was right next to the Plaza Premium Lounge, and very close to the boarding gate for SQ1 as well. I thought it was a great place to spend the short layover before the continuation to Singapore. For one, it was quite empty at that hour. Also, it had GREAT tarmac views. And the F&B selection was surprisingly good for a UA lounge too. I'll let the pics do the talking... "
[HKG] United Club,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/13265-/page1," A fairly large lounge, with several seating zones, each a little different.

Bright and airy with great tarmac views. While there isn't any ice cream or congee the day I was there (If I recall correctly, the previous SKL served congee for breakfast, and also had tubs of Haagen Daaz ice cream...) I thought the F&B selection was more than I would expect from a UA lounge. The really nice thing about this lounge was that it was fairly quiet and peaceful in the morning, during the time of the SQ1 transit stop. I am looking forward to the new SQ lounge, but if the SQ lounge is a long walk away from the gate, then the United Club would make a perfectly good alternative pit stop while in transit. "

Who said the TG F lounge was tired ?. Not when I've been in there, and I was last there about 4 weeks ago. It's a great lounge, and never gets anything like full. The main J lounge is showing a few signs of wear but if you're in TG F you'll get whisked straight through there on a buggy anyway. If SQ F you walk through it to get to the F lounge. I never used that main J lounge anyway, it was too busy. There are two smaller ones at the beginning of the C concourse so I go in the one on the right that looks across the D gates apron where the Golden Birds park. "

There are toilets, but they are very basic and, as there is only one male and one female toilet, there can be quite a queue at busy times. (There is a very large public toilet about 20 metres away outside the lounge). Sadly no showers. Probably because PER doesn't get many transit passengers. Some people might call it small, but I prefer the term ""cosy"" I can't compare with MNL or KUL as I have never been to those. But here are some pictures of PER.

TPR - Flight display boards removed!,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14499-/page1," I was bemused to note the flight boards are still missing from TPR and you do have to wonder if this moronic decision is permanent. When I checked in last week my gate was still unknown and while the White Ladies in there are pretty good at keeping track of where you are going, especially when it's a quiet like it is prior to SQ52, they shouldn't have to try and remember to come around and remind you when the screen was there to do that. And with how often they want to remind you about getting to the gate on time at Changi this is a truly baffling decision. "
TPR - Flight display boards removed!,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14499-/page1," Separated this into a thread of it's own to save it getting lost in the main one. I have to say the way SQ have or are handling this is farcical. First of all I was told the same as Cruiser Elite, that Changi (the airport itself) had removed the screens, which never made any sense from the off. The second and third times I was in there the reply was it was 'a management decision'. However, having filled in a complaint form on the original visit I finally got an official reply a few weeks ago and this is some of it: The monitors were removed because we wanted our lounge staff to provide a more personalised service to our TPR passengers. Lounge staff in TPR approach passengers personally when flight is boarding or if there is a gate change or delay unlike other sections of the lounge where passengers have to find a screen to check on flight details. In the recent upgrading exercise, we felt that the screen can be removed as our lounge staff are communicating the flight information personally to passengers. We have briefed our staff to be vigilant and proactive if they see passengers roaming around where the screens used to be. OK, that's pretty clear but you really do have to ask why they were told to tell us lies about it initially ?!. If they are doing this new personalised service, and they clearly are from my recent experience, why not just tell us this instead of telling outright lies that 'Changi have taken them down' On the subject itself, I remain bemused by the decision and think its wrong. It's all well and good saying they will remember where everyone in there is flying, and that's been easy last few visits when it's been dead. But that's a tricky one to keep up when it's full during the large early and late banks of departures each day. The closest screens now are back in the corridor just after the SKL J lounge, which is quite a trek from TPR and means you either leave your belongings there and walk there and back or pack everything up while you walk there and back. I think the fact they initially blatantly lied bout the reason they had gone shows some people involved in this are not convinced by it either... "

TPR - Flight display boards removed!,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/14499-/page1," I could be wrong but these current screens are probably ""rented"" from Changi Airport which consolidates all the flight info from all 3 terminals. Being their lounge, SQ could custom-build their own SQ flights only screen. However, I'm not sure if the cost of building (as well as maintaining the system) it for a few screens in their lounges is worth their while. "

Besides eating, drinking, sleeping and taking a bath. I read somewhere DVDs are available? Any massaging facilities? I personally will not stay that long at the lounge. I would rather go to the city. Taking S-Bahn about 15-20 minutes. Go to Zeil for window shopping or walking around Romer. Better buy the snacks or gourmet food in the city. (BTW if you go to FCL, there is only one duty free - small - and no knick knack shops or other kind of shops, and no dot dot dot kino as well.. ) I am not o sure what you prefer about gourmet food. I am just a commoner who likes to by commoner goodies... I would suggest you have dinner at FCT. Thus back by S-bahn after 6pm or taking taxi in style to be drop off at the FCT curbside.

In fact, if they advised me to go to the main terminal to buy a memory stick that I thought I needed (they did offer to call ahead to the shops to check for availability). Originally posted by phaleesy View Post I also wanted to find out if the lounge serves any exotic non-alcoholic cocktails. Nothing that merited a special mention in the restaurant's menu. As a first-timer myself this past Christmas holiday, I think that if I had a longer transit, I'd have gained weight from sampling from the a la carte and buffet selection.

Does this mean you can no longer access the VS CH if flying on SQ metal??? From 1 May 2009, as a part of an agreement with Virgin Atlantic, access to SilverKris Lounges and Virgin Atlantic Clubhouses will be based on the airline operating the flight that our members are traveling on. SilverKris Lounge access is available to Flying Club Gold members only when they travel on a flight operated by Singapore Airlines. Likewise, Clubhouse access will be available to PPS Club and KrisFlyer Elite Gold members when they take a flight operated by Virgin Atlantic (i.e. if the aircraft is operated by Virgin Atlantic). Solitaire PPS Club and Life members will continue to enjoy the services of Virgins Revivals arrival lounge in London when they travel on SQ322 to London. For more information on Virgin Atlantic Clubhouses, please click here. PPS Club members will continue to have their current access to SilverKris Lounges around the world whenever they travel on Singapore Airlines and SilkAir. For more information on SilverKris Lounges, please click here. And as Star Alliance Gold members, PPS Club and KrisFlyer Elite Gold members will continue to have access to all Star Alliance lounges when they travel on a Star Alliance airline. In Singapore, Star Alliance lounges are the SATS Premier Club at Terminal 2 and KrisFlyer Gold Lounge at Terminal 3. More information on Star Alliance lounges can be found here. "

If it was just LHR I would have suspected it was related to the spat they had when SQ moved to the VS check-in area, and then announced they would use Aviance staff instead of VS. But it's everywhere. I wonder if it's because they charged each other for useage ?. In which case SQ must be taking a pounding as the VS CH's are in a different world to the drab SKL's. The staff at the VS CH at LHR have regularly commented along the lines of 'Crikey, do none of you lot use the Singapore lounge ?', as they add another name to the list. "

Also, as everyone says, it is one less reason to fly SQ ex-LHR Originally posted by Kyo View Post Looks like I may have to book a BD flight ex-LHR someday to get access. You don't get access to the VSCH on a BD flight, only if you are flying VS metal (same as the new SQ rule). Wonder how long the BD*G perk will last for under LH... If only VS was a decent airline, then it would be ok to have to fly VS, but it's torture in Y, and the UC seat just isn't that special - not worth putting up with the amateur service and substandard food/drink for. Flying club is also quite possibly the most stingy and inflexible FFP in the world. It makes Krisflyer and BAEC look generous... "

Hanoi Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6339-/page1, Just wondering whether Business Class SQ travellers have access to a lounge in Hanoi. Any info most welcome. 
Hanoi Lounge,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/6339-/page1," Welcome to SQTalk, webbie Yes there is a lounge for SQ pax. It's to the right after you got through immigration. It's a shared lounge, nothing special and can get busy so I wouldn't go earlier to spend extra time there or anything. I actually quite like the next floor up which is all but empty and very quiet save for a small restaurant in the corner. I haven't departed on SQ from Hanoi for a while so this could have changed recently, but HAN is so quiet I would be surprised if much is different. "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page6," HKG SilverKris Lounge Update (Aug 2019) I visited the SQ SilverKris Lounge yesterday before flying home on SQ1 HKG-SIN, after a short visit to Hong Kong this week. This was just a brief visit to Hong Kong -- in fact I spent all my time in Kowloon, and didn't head over to Hong Kong island itself, as all my business meetings were on the Kowloon side. I'll save my brief impressions of Hong Kong and the airport situation during these turbulent times for a subsequent TR, but thankfully I experienced minimal delays or hitches on my trip. I did visit the J section of the SQ SilverKris Lounge in Hong Kong, and here is a brief update on the lounge facilities and catering. Showers aside (Which are brand new), not a lot has changed since the lounge underwent a full refurb to the ""Home Away from Home"" concept in late 2014. Most significantly, the location remains a windowless location, in an airport where many other lounges are located in large airy atriums with beautiful airside views. On the positive side, the lounge is quite close to the SQ boarding gates, which makes it quite a convenient pitstop before the flight. Ironically, right above the SQ lounge are two beautiful lounges: The Qantas Hong Kong Lounge, and the new CX lounge ""The Deck"", both of which would have been great places for SQ to have a lounge. "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page6," Upon entering the lounge, there is a small seating area close to the entrance... ...before a long passageway which leads to the main J and F lounges as well as the showers/restrooms. I've never visited the F section on the left. Instead, I went straight and headed to the J section... The bar remains a full service, manned, bar... The drink list... The liquor selection... Tiger and Asahi on tap... Always nice to start a lounge visit with bubbles (In this case Moet & Chandon Imperial...) "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page6," There was a large breakfast buffet selection on offer... Tables for sit-down dining... Elsewhere, various seating options... ...and work pods... "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page6," The breakfast selection comprised both Asian and International/Western selections... Salads... Delicious HK-style congee with condiments... Fried flat rice noodles/rolls... Noodles with black pepper chicken... Sauages, baked beans and scrambled eggs... A small selection of single-serve cereal boxes was also available. Dim sum... Soy bean curd... The freezer cabinet, which was previously stocked with ice cream, was empty that morning, but I don't know if that was temporary or if they no longer serve ice cream in the lougne. Overall I thought this was a good F&B spread, with the Asian selections looking more interesting that the Western breakfast options. "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page6," The lounge had attached restrooms... ...and two brand new shower rooms, which were very well equipped... "
HKG SKL Reopen after Refurb,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11642-/page6," To sum up my current impression of this lounge: it is a decent lounge, with good F&B options. It is great that the showers have been refurbished too. Proximity to the boarding gates were a plus as well. The main negative for me is that it is (still) a windowless lounge in an airport where so many other lounges have wonderful views, open airy atriums, and great ambience. There are at least 2 other lounges in HKG available to Krisflyer Gold/PPS/Star Alliance Gold members: the United Lounge and Thai Airways Lounge, both of which are larger and offer better ambience in large, open spaces (Although UA catering was quite minimal compared to SQ). However, these other lounges are located quite far from the SQ gates, which would make it quite inconvenient to visit if you were short of time. As mentioned in the past, I would visit this lounge for a quick snack and a drink, and maybe a shower, before heading out to enjoy the shopping and ambience outside. Not a lounge I would want to spend a lot of time in, given how wonderful the HKG airside area is. "

I'm flying on SQ15, and I was wondering if I have to pay the $35 fee that Virgin America F Pax have to pay if I use the VS Clubhouse with my SQ F ticket? Also, is the SFO VS Clubhouse great or just mediocre? The VS site does not say much about it. "

One has to exit security and go thru another security in order to get to A side, they are not connected together. Btw, SQ SKL shower at SFO no matter F or C side are both crapy. First you have to ask the attendant for a towel, and there is only ""one"" towel. There is not another towel on the floor to dry your feet after you are out of the shower. There is a dispenser for soap and shampoo. Since there is no towel you can put on the floor, however they have a plastic mat, it may be slippery as the water may spill out as the shower curtain does not go down to the floor, and no high bar on the floor to stop the water from flowing out. If one if flying F, I recommend shower in the UA IFL instead, it is more proper and they give you a shower kit. "

Wow! that's nasty. I wish all the R / F and LPPS / TPPS can really enjoy each other company without having to pass judgment on each others. It is a sad world if it has to come to that. Why can't everyone be just like us who is always looking forward to that next lounge meeting? As I said, there were many occasions when Solitaires not-in-F behaving as a pita at SKL F. Those situation made the paid F to write a feedback. And again, just a tiny portion pita spoils the whole milk. Also remember, many would not give feedback. Those the result of the feedbacks could be biased towards pax who were upset with some Solitaire-not-in-F experience. "

Welcome to SQTalk, yiserexoica. Thanks for the live update. Interesting, the 'paid passengers' bit. I guess they're serious about the exclusivity. Redemption pax are considered riffraff?

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page4," I am sure SQ will find a way. If it is true, I find it disturbing that SQ is trying so hard to differentiate its paid and its upgraded by miles redemption F passengers. I feel humiliated by this and I am truly disappointed with SQ. What will come next? Different meal service and different treatment by cabin crew for the paid and the upgraded by miles redemption F passengers on air? This dark side of SQ is really scary. "
[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page4," If the report is true, I agree with you, UMD. One of the most appealing features of SQ service is that there is no discrimination between paying and redemption passengers. This makes people look forward to redeeming on SQ, and encourages them to show loyalty (either to SQ or to a partner) on the road to that redemption. This treatment would erode that goodwill quite a lot. "
[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page4," I do agree that in my experiences so far in the past 7 years being a pax on SQ, there was no differential treatment whether I was a full paid F fares, or I was a paid discounted F fares (such as booked in A), or I was booked in O (due to all miles award tix, or an upgrade using miles). I know some airlines will have a manifest that showed the booking class, even on its Boarding Pass. But on SQ, if you look at the BP, there is no differentiation at all. First is red. And Suites is golden. Thus, I wonder how the SKL staff can glance at the booking classes of each BP. Unless by swiping them through the magnetic reader to get the pax BP information. "

As far as I know, the only thing that VS pax do not get when upgrading to, or redeeming in, the Upper Class is the free limo transfer. There is no discrimination in lounge access - which is of course the way it should be. I'd be very very surprised (but not particularly bothered one way or the other, to be quite frank) if redemption F tickets were not allowed to enter - that would be just a very odd thing to do. But whatever is inside the lounge, it's never going to be worth going to the airport extra early for. "

Quite an exciting first post. Originally posted by yiserexoica View Post Not all red and golden BP holders are eligible to enter. Only PAID passengers are allowed. I wonder if they actually mean paid (cash, miles redemption or upgrade using miles) vs unpaid (i.e. opup) ? In the case of BA, for example, an opup at check-in is not technically allowed access to the lounges; but otherwise, all other pax (cash, miles redemption or upgrade using miles) are treated the same (subject only to OW and BA CIP status) on the ground and in the air.

There is no discrimination in lounge access - which is of course the way it should be. My bad, I should have been more specific: not for op-ups. I was op-upped once from paid PE to UC, and I was told (very gently) at the lounge that my upgrade did not entitle me to lounge access. You're right, though: my experience does not encompass redemption pax. EDIT: jhm noted the distinction. Of course, in that case, it's bizarre that they mentioned the distinction to yiserexoica. It's not as though op-ups are that common on SQ, and therefore would erode the lounge exclusivity. "

Just because SQ hasn't been competitive with its lounges doesn't mean customers shouldn't expect something better with the opening of a new lounge.

I expect it to be 'cozily crowded' on a Fri evening with F & C pax and TPPs and QPPS in there. SQ establishing its own SQ KF Gold and *G lounge means maybe that they want to keep that revenue now for themselves rather than passing it on to SATS.

You could use the the LH Lounges, too. If I am correct, they do not care about the printed boarding pass over there. The LX lounges in ZRH are opreated by Swissport in behalf of LX. Therefore, lounge hopping is not prohibited, but it's not that easy anymore. Since the LH lounge is in my eyes the nicer one, I suggest you visit this one first and since it's a bit more far away from the gates, and move some minutes prior to boarding to the LX lounge or the Bellevue Lounge in Terminal E (you could not use this lounge if you are flying to the US !!).

MAN lounge access on SQ Y as non-SQ *G?,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/11152-/page1," Greetings all Moved to Singapore this year and so have shifted most of my business flying from NH to SQ, which I have enjoyed!

According to staralliance.com, while SWISS has four *G lounges available for me at ZRH, the only *G lounges at MAN appear to be Terminal 3 (bmi's lounges), with SQ departing T2. What does SQ do for lounge access for PPS/Elite Golds departing MAN in Y? Presumably it offers the same contract lounge (Escape T2) it offers to F/J pax to them, or is it T3 or nothing at all? Being a long way apart, that effectively means no lounge access. Will they give another *G access to a lounge in T2? To complicate matters we will be a family of 4, two *G parents, one child, one infant, so need to bring them as guests into the lounge (with ANA at least, infants are not counted for lounge purposes, since they cannot hold FF cards either). I have some more q's on this trip re MAN which I shall ask elsewhere on the forums. "

They dropped it not long after. I personally quite enjoyed Escape Too with the personally roped off area for us in F and while the food was basic it was no worse than most other generic lounges around the world and you could order a bacon butty if you wanted. They even refused to let Priority Pass users access until they checked with SQ and DL how many guests were due in, and not many would do that and turn the money down. We'll see how it goes anyway. To be fair I am not on SQ327 half as much as SQ328, and I haven't even tried it again yet.

Anyone happened to have snapped photos of it already? No photos. But I'm sitting in it right now, and typing from it too. And the first thing I did, after getting a water to dry out from the first sector, was sit down and login to SQtalk. Totally revamped. I showed my transit card and BP at the desk, thinking nothing afoot, and walked in, only to find myself totally plussed (ant. non-plussed) by the lounge, getting only a few feet before going back to the boy at the desk to inquire, ""I was here a week ago. This is totally different, right? I haven't lost my mind, have I?"" ""Yes, totally different. Please, come on in..."" So, the color scheme is very much like the new F, and the materials and such are like what you'd find at SIN T3. Somewhat oddly, there is still a front desk with two sides to pass through when entering, but both sides lead to the same room, which is a long deep room with computer terminals-- tons of them-- looking vaguely like a trading floor. (They wanted the full HKG look, no?) Behind that, is a wet bar with refreshments and a compact seating area. For additionaly seating areas, you can go fairly far to the left, and fairly far to the right, giving the whole thing a suggestion of caverns with no discernable end (Think, Indiana Jones, Episode III, catacombs of Venice scene, sans rats.) On the whole, I'd say it a marked improvement from the worn-out, wrung-out, tired old thing we all came to know, love, and hate whilst in transit on SQ 001/002. Still no ramp/airfield view. But one can't expect The World, can one? I have only an hour before my onward flight, but that's enough time to skulk about. Seems like lots of arriving pax, overheard at the front desk, are asking, ""Is this the Singapore Airlines Lounge?"" Now, shall I find a First Class section? A Private Room? With 77W's and A380's routinely plying the SIN-HKG route, I should think so. Let's go and have a look.... "

[HKG] SKL at HKIA (post-renovation),http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/3208-/page2," Just passed through today. I must say I'm really impressed! Kudos to SQ for upping their game on the highly competitive HKG-SIN market, though it obviously falls way way behind what The Pier offers. As to a section for the F class passengers, there indeed is one with a signboard outside stating reserved for Suites, First and Solitaire PPS, though I can see it's not visibly enforced. The corridors really never seem to end but the only downside is that there isn't a toilet and you have to exit the lounge and it's to the left. "

Somehow they manage to differentiate by printing ""you're invited to the private room"" vs ""you're invited to SKL"" on the BP. Lordy, they really did call it The Private Room. I thought SQ LPP was just being his cheeky self! Should we hear foreboding bass tones (the Darth Vader theme comes to mind) when we talk about The Private Room? "

Please tell me this is not true. I was led to believe that anyone with a Red or Gold BP is allowed in, regardless of award, upgrade-with-miles or paid. I would be stunned if they stopped award or upgraded with miles trips going in. That would be beyond belief, even by SQ's recent standards. Originally posted by yiserexoica View Post Yes there is a separate dinning area. In fact there's an A la carte menu. And yes tarmac. BTW I believe that was the best seat for tarmac view. Roti Prata !!!.... and (knock me down with a feather) a tarmac view....I think I'm going to faint. Originally posted by jhm View Post Although we talk on SQT about lounges more than most people , I think we also shouldn't lose sight of the fact that The Private Room is a lounge and - at the end of the day - like all lounges, simply a glorified waiting room for a journey from A to B. Most non-transit passengers don't (like some of us on here) arrive at the lounge hours and hours in advance. For most, it's a wait of an hour or so with the opportunity to grab a drink (which doesn't mean how many bottles to get through ), catch up on e-mails etc. For those who actually have a long layover, Changi Airport has plenty to keep anyone amused; and if you have an overnight, the place to stay (even if some of us don't do so) is really a hotel rather than the lounge itself. TPR is no doubt fit for purpose but it's not (nor meant to be) a life changing experience and we should align our expectations accordingly. That would be all well and good for no more than a mid tier airline going through the motions. Unfortunately it's not. This is SQ, widely accepted by many of those of sane mind and with a pulse of being the best airline on the planet. This is also the airline that 'other airlines talk about', with whom you can 'travel in a new light', have recently introduced a 'class beyond first' and last year created a 'more exclusive' FFP. On top of this they offer us the privilege of paying more than all the other airlines out there to enjoy their fabulous hospitality. So, when they spring a sub standard F lounge on us, (by 'us' I mean those of us who pay a fair whack of money to fly on them and are top tier on them and not a competitor ) folk are going to have a moan. If LH, VS, BA, CX, MH, TG etc etc etc think top quality lounges are important, there is no reason SQ shouldn't. So, MR BA Gold , you enjoy your lovely new BA lounges in the new T5, and us transit pax (as that is what most pax on SQ are) can discuss the plusses and minuses of SQ's new waiting rooms. Originally posted by yiserexoica View Post I actually did ask the opinion of a lounge agent regarding excluding TPPs and those travelling with a mile-upgraded F BP from TPR, and guess what answer did I receive? ""Exclusivity""! I see they've not got bored of using the 'Ex' word. Welcome to SQTalk, yiserexoica, and thank you for the great report and pictures. "

[SIN]  The Private Room at SKL T3,http://www.sqtalk.com/forum/forum/singapore-airlines/sq-operated-partner-and-contract-lounges/4402-/page6," Originally posted by infrequentflyer View Post I feel it's still behind Thai's 1st class lounge. I am most probably wrong but it feels like SQ keeps innovating with things like the suites (after the 777er 1st class product) and now this lounge because the first attempt didn't really hit the mark. I missed this before! Jut to clarify. SQ did not launch the Suites because the new 77W F seats didn't 'hit the mark' The Suites were ready a couple of years before they were launched, and were supposed to be revealed during a singing dancing flagship launch of the A380, which would have also revealed the lflat bed JCL at the same time. Unfortunately the A380 delays put paid to this so they were forced to reveal the new J and the 77W F when SQ got the first 77W. They had to keep the Suites under wraps until the A380 was ready. Interesting comment regarding comparisons with TG's F lounge, which is indeed an excellent lounge. I'll see what I make of the TPR before making a comparision. Welcome to SQTalk !.

My question is which lounge will SQ use for their J/F pax on SQ 26 to JFK from now on? Or is SQ going to be moving this flight to a different pier as well? "
